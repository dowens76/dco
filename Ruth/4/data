\v 1 And Boaz went up\f + \ft \f* to the gate and he sat there and behold the redeemer whom Boaz had spoken about was passing through and he said, "Turn aside\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s, \f* , sit here, certain one," so he turned aside and he sat down.
\v 2 And he took ten men from the elders of the city and he said, "Sit here," and they sat.
\v 3 And he said to the redeemer, "The portion of the field which is our brother Elimelech's Naomi is selling\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, f, s, \f* , the one who returned from the land of Moab.
\v 4 And I said "I will reveal your ear saying, Take possession' before the ones who are sitting and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem, redeem. But if you will not redeem, tell me and I will know because there is no one to redeem except\f + \ft BDB 265\f* you and I am after you."
\p And he said, "I will redeem."
\p
\v 5 And Boaz said, "On the day you aqcuire the land from the hand of Naomi and you will take acquire of Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead over his inheritance."
\p
\v 6 And the redeemer said, "I am not able to redeem to me lest I shall destroy my inheritance. Redeem to yourself my redemption because I am not able to redeem."
\p
\v 7 And this was before in Israel upon the redemption and upon the exchange to raise up all the matter a man would draw up his sandal and he would give it to the other and this was the testimony in Israel.
\p
\v 8 And the redeemer said to Boaz, "Acquire it for yourself." And he drew out his sandal.
\p
\v 9 And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, "You are witnesses today that I have acquired all which was Elimelech's and all which was Kilion's and Mahlon's from the hand of Naomi
\v 10 and also Ruth the Moabitess wife of Mahlon I have acquired for myself for a wife to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance and the name of the dead shall not be cut from with his brothers and the gate of this place. You are witnesses today."
\p
\v 11 And all the people who were at the gate and the elders said, "We are witnesses; may the Lord grant the woman who is coming to your house to be like Rachel and Leah who the two of them built the house of Israel and make\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s, \f* strength among Ephrathah and call a name in Bethlehem.
\v 12 And may it be in your house like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah from the seed which the Lord shall give to you from this young woman."
\p
\v 13 So Boaz took Ruth and she was to him for a wife and he came to her and the Lord gave to her conception and she bore a son.
\v 14 And the women said to Naomi, "Blessed be the Lord who has not caused to fail for you a redeemer this day and may his name be called in Israel.
\v 15 And he will be for you to return life and to sustain\f + \ft \f* your old age because your daughter-in-law who loved you who is better for you that seven sons has born him."
\v 16 And Naomi took the child and she set him in her lap and she was for him for a nurse.
\v 17 And the women dwelling there named him saying, "A son was born to Naomi." And they called his name Obed who was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
\p
