\v 7 "And now thus you will say to my servant David, 'Thus says YHWH of Hosts: I took you from the flock from after teh sheep to be prince over my people Israel.
\v 8 And I will be with you in every place where you go and I will cut down all your enemies from before you and I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.
\v 9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and plant them and they will dwell in (under?) it and they will not tremble again and the children of injustice will not continue to consume them as in former times,
\v 10 and to the days that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will humble all your enemes and I declare to you that YHWH will build a house for you.
\v 11 And it will be when your days are full to go with your fathers that I will raise your seed after you who will be from your sons* and I will establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He will build for me a house and I will establish his throne forever.
\v 13 I will be a father to him and he will be a son to me, and my fidelity I will not turn aside from him as I turned it aside from he who* was before you.
\v 14 And I will make him stand in my house and in my kingdom forever and his throne will be established forever.'"
\v 15 According to all these words and according to all this vision thus Nathan spoke to David.
\v 16 And the king David came and sat before YHWH and said, "Who am I, YHWH God, and who is my house that you brought me hither?
\v 17 And this was small in your eyes, O God, that you speak over the house of your servant to afar and you see me as ??? of man, the upward movement (?), YHWH God.
