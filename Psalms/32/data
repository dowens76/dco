\c 32
\p
\v 1 Of David, a Maskil.
\q1 Blessed is the one whose transgressions are forgiven,
\q1 Whose sin is covered.
\q1
\v 2 Blessed is the man whose guilt the Lord does not count against him,
\q1 And in whose spirit there is no deceit.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 3 When I kept silent my bones wasted away,
\q1 In my groaning all day long.
\q1
\v 4 For day and night your hand\f + Cf. Ps. 24:4.\f* was heavy upon me,
\q1 My strength\f + ?\f* was destroyed by the heat of summer.
\q1
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin to you,
\q1 And my guilt I did not cover,
\q1 I said, I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,\f + Cf. Ps 15:2.\f*
\q1 And you forgave the guilt of my sin.
\q1
\v 6 Because of this let the faithful pray to you at a time you may be found,
\q1 Only in the flood of many waters they will not reach him.
\q1
\v 7 You are a hiding place for me,
\q1 You keep me from distress,
\q1 You surround me with shouts of deliverance.
\q1
\v 8 I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go
\q1 I will give counsel with my eye upon you.
\q1
\v 9 Do not be like a horse or mule that does not understand
\q1 Bit and bridle are his ornament to curb him, he does not stay near you
\q1
\v 10 Many are the sufferings of the wicked,
\q1 But steadfast love surrounds him who trusts in the Lord.
\q1
\v 11 Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, O righteous ones,
\q1 And shout for joy all you upright in heart.
