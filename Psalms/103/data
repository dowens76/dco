\v 1 Of David
\q1 Bless the Lord O my soul,
\q1 And all that is within me his holy name.
\q1
\v 2 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
\q1 And do not forget all his rewards,
\q1
\v 3 The one who forgives all your offenses,
\q1 Who heals all your diseases.
\q1
\v 4 The one who redeems your life from the pit,
\q1 Who crowns you with steadfast love and compassion.
\q1
\v 5 The one who satisfies you with good things\f + \ft ornaments?\f*
\q1 Your youth is renewed like the eagle.
\q1
\v 6 The Lord does righteousness
\q1 And justice for all the oppressed\f + \ft Qal Pass. Part.\f*
\q1
\v 7 He made known his ways to Moses,
\q1 To the Israelites his deeds.
\q1
\v 8 The Lord is compassionate and gracious,
\q1 Slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love.
\q1
\v 9 He does not dispute forever,
\q1 And he does not preserve his anger forever.
\p
\v 10 He does not deal with us according to our sin,
\q1 And he does not do to us according to our guilt.
\p
\v 11 For as high as the heavens are over the earth,
\q1 So great his is steadfast love for those who fear him.
\p
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west,
\q1 So far has he removed our transgressions from us.
\p
\v 13 As a father shows compassion on his children,
\q1 So does the Lord show compassion on those who fear him.
\p
\v 14 For he knows our form,
\q1 He remembers that we are dust.
\p
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass,
\q1 Like the blossoms of the field so he blossoms.
\p
\v 16 For the wind passes over it,
\q1 And it is no more,
\q1 Its place no longer knows it.
\p
\v 17 But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting for those who fear him,
\q1 And his righteousness for sons of sons.
\p
\v 18 To those who keep his covenant
\q1 And remember his directions to do them.
\p
\v 19 The Lord has established his throne in the heavens,
\q1 And his kindgom reigns over all.
\q1
\v 20 Bless the Lord, you his angels,
\q1 You mighty ones who do his word,
\q1 To obey his word.
\q1
\v 21 Bless the Lord, all his hosts,
\q1 His ministers who do his will.
\q1
\v 22 Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion
\q1 Bless the Lord, O my soul.
