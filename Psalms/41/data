\d To the director, a psalm of David
\q1
\v 2 Happy is the one who is understanding toward the powerless,\f + Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1 In the day of trouble YHWH saves him.
\q1
\v 3 May YHWH keep him and keep him alive,
\q1 May he be called fortunate in the land,
\q1 And do not give him in the life of his enemies!
\q1
\v 4 YHWH supports him on his sickbed,
\q1 All his couch, you overturn his illness.
\q1
\v 5 I have said, "O YHWH, be gracious to me,
\q1 Heal my life for I have sinned against you.
\q1
\v 6 My enemies speak evil to me,
\q1 'When will he die and his name perish?'
\q1
\v 7 If he comes to see he speaks deceit,
\q1 His heart gathers trouble to him,\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1 He goes outside, he speaks.\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 8 Together they whisper against me, all those who hate me,
\q1 Against me they devise harm for me.
\q1
\v 9 A worthless word is spread against me,
\q1 And that 'he has laid down, he will not rise again.'
\q1
\v 10 Even my man of peace in whom I have trusted, the one who eats my bread,
\q1 He has made a heel great against me.\f + Vv. 7-10, Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 11 But you, O YHWH, be gracious to me,
\q1 And raise me up,
\q1 And I will repay them.\f + ???\f*
\q1
\v 12 In this I have known that you are pleased with me,
\q1 For my enemy has not shouted over me.
\q1
\v 13 And I in my integrity\f + Ps 15:2.\f*, you take hold of me,
\q1 You make me stand before you forever.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 14 Blessed be YHWH, the God of Israel,
\q1 From everlasting to everlasting,
\q1 Amen and amen.
