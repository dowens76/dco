\v 1 A prayer of Moses, man of God
\q1 Lord you have been our dwelling place in all generations
\q1
\v 2 before the mountains were born
\q1 And you had brought to birth the earth and the world
\q1 From everlasting to everlasting you are God.
\q1
\v 3 You return man to dust
\q1 And you say, “Return, O son of man.”
\q1
\v 4 For a thousand years in your sight
\q1 Are like yesterday when it has passed
\q1 And like a watch in the night.
\q1
\v 5 You put an end to them
\q1 They are sleep
\q1 Like grass renewed in the morning.
\q1
\v 6 In the moring it sprouts and is renewed
\q1 To evening it withers and dries up.
\q1
\v 7 For we come to an end in your anger
\q1 And in your anger we are terrified.
\q1
\v 8 You have set our sins before you,
\q1 Our hidden things before the lamp of your face.
\q1
\v 9 For all of our days turn under your rage,
\q1 We come to an end of our years like a groan.
\q1
\v 10 The days of our years in them are seventy years
\q1 Or if by strength eighty years
\q1 And their extent is distress and trouble
\q1 For it passes by in haste and we fly away.
\q1
\v 11 Who knows the strength of your anger,
\q1 And according to your fear your anger?
\q1
\v 12 To number our days thus teach\f + \ft us\f*
\q1 That we may come to a heart of wisdom.
\q1
\v 13 Return, O Lord! How long
\q1 And have pity on your servants.
\q1
\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love
\q1 And we will shout with joy and rejoice for all of our days.
\q1
\v 15 Make us glad according to the days you oppressed us,
\q1 The years we have seen evil.
\q1
\v 16 Let your work be visible to your servants,
\q1 And your grandeur to their children.
\q1
\v 17 And let the kindness of the Lord our god be on us,
\q1 And establish the work of our hands for us.
