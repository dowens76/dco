\v 2 May YHWH answer you in the day of distress,

\q1 And your burnt offerings may he accept.\qs Selah\qs*

\q1 And all your counsel may he fill.
\q1
\v 6 May we shout for joy over your salvation,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 And in the name of our God lift up our banners.
\q1
\v 7 Now I know that YHWH will save his anointed,
\q1 He will answer from his holy heaven,
\q1 With powerful deeds of salvation of his right hand.
\q1
\v 8 These in chariot and these in horses,
\q1 But we summon the name of YHWH our God.
\q1
\v 9 They bend the knee and they fall,
\q1 But we stand up and help each other up.
\q1
\v 10 O YHWH, save the king,
\q1 May he answer us on the day we call.
