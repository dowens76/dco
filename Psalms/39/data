\v 1
\d For the director, for Jeduthun, a psalm of David
\q1
\v 2 I have said, "I will watch my way from sinning with my tongue,
\q1 I will keep a muzzle on my mouth,
\q1 While the wicked is still before me.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4?\f*
\q1
\v 3 I was speechless, silence,
\q1 I was silent from good,\f + NRSV/ESV: "to no avail." Cf. Barr, Comparative Philology, p. 17:מִטֹוב "from speaking."\f*
\q1 And my pain was anguished.
\q1
\v 4 My heart became hot in me,
\q1 In my groaning a fire burned,
\q1 I spoke with my tongue.
\q1
\v 5 Make known my end to me, O YHWH,
\q1 And what is the measure of my days,
\q1 Let me know how fleeting I am.
\q1
\v 6 Behold you have made my days handbreadths,
\q1 And my lifetime like there is nothing before you,
\q1 Indeed all breath, all man stands. \qs Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 7 Indeed a man walks about in a shadow,
\q1 Indeed breath, they make noise,
\q1 He heaps up but does not know who will gather them.
\q1
\v 8 But now for what do I wait, O Lord,
\q1 My hope is in you.
\q1
\v 9 From all my transgressions rescue me,
\q1 Do not make me the abuse of the fool.\f + Cf. Pss 15 and 24.\f*
\q1
\v 10 I am speechless, I do not open my mouth,
\q1 For you have done it.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.s\f*
\q1
\v 11 Remove your blow from upon me,
\q1 Because of the agitation of your hand I am at an end.
\q1
\v 12 With reprimands you have disiplined a man for sin,
\q1 And you have melted like a moth what he desires,
\q1 Indeed all mankind is breath. \qs Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 13 Hear my prayer, O YHWH,
\q1 I cry for help, hear!
\q1 Do not be deaf to my tears,
\q1 For I am a sojourner with you,\f + Ps 15:1.\f*
\q1 An alien, like all my ancestors.
\q1
\v 14 Look away from me, and I will be happy,\f + Ps 15:1, 24:3.\f*
\q1 Before I go and I am no more.
