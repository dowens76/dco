\c 8
\p
\v 1 For the song director, according to the gittith, a psalm of David,
\q1
\v 2 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth
\q1 Who set your majesty on the heavens
\q1
\v 3 From the mouth children and babes
\q1 you have appointed praise/strength?
\q1 Because of those who are hostile to you,
\q1 to silence the enemy and the avenger
\q1
\v 4 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers
\q1 The moon and the stars which you have established
\q1
\v 5 What is man that you remember him
\q1 And a son of man that you pay attention to him?
\q1
\v 6 You have made him lack a little from angels
\q1 And with glory and splendor you have crowned him
\q1
\v 7 You have given him dominion over the works of your hands
\q1 All things you have set under his feet
\q1
\v 8 Flocks and cattle, all of them
\q1 And even the beasts of the field
\q1
\v 9 The birds of the air and the fish of the sea
\q1 Who pass through the ways of the sea
\q1
\v 10 O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth
