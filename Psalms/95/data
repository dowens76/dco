\v 1 Come, let us shout with joy to the Lord,
\q1 Let us shout to the rock of our salvation!
\q1
\v 2 Let us come before him with thanksgiving,
\q1 With songs let us shout to him.
\q1
\v 3 For the Lord is a Great God
\q1 And a Great King over all gods.
\q1
\v 4 In whose hand are the depths of the earth,
\q1 And the tops of the mountains are his.
\q1
\v 5 To him belong the sea and he made it,
\q1 And his hands formed the dry ground.
\q1
\v 6 Come, let us worship and bow down,
\q1 Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker,
\q1
\v 7 For he is our God,
\q1 And we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand.
\q1 Today if you hear his voice,
\q1
\v 8 Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah,
\q1 Like the day at Massah in the wilderness.
\q1
\v 9 When your fathers put me to the test and tested me,
\q1 Even though they saw my works.
\p
\v 10 Forty years I felt disgust for that generation and I said,
\q1 “They are a people who wander off in their heart,
\q1 And they have not known my ways.”
\p
\v 11 So I swore in my anger,
\q1 “They shall not enter my rest.”
