\v 1
\d For the director, of the servant of YHWH, of David, when he spoke to YHWH the words of this song in the day YHWH delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul.
\q1
\v 2 I love you, YHWH, my strength.
\q1
\v 3 YHWH is my rock and my stronghold, and my deliverer,
\q1 My God, my rock, I take refuge in him,
\q1 My shield and the horn of my salvation, my high spot.
\q1
\v 4 The one who is praised, I call on YHWH,
\q1 And from my enemies I will be saved.
\q1
\v 5 Cords of death surrounded me,
\q1 And the streams of wickedness terrify me.
\q1
\v 6 Cords of Sheol go around me,
\q1 The snares of death contront me.
\q1
\v 7 In my distress I called on YHWH,
\q1 And to my God I cried for help,
\q1 He heard my voice from his temple,
\q1 And my cry for help before him came to his ears.
\q1
\v 8 The earth rose and fell noisily and shook,
\q1 And the foundations of the mountains quaked and they rose and fell noisily,
\q1 For he became angry.
\q1
\v 9 Smoke went up in his nose,
\q1 And fire from his mouth will consume,
\q1 Live coals blazed from him.
\q1
\v 10 And he bent down the heavens and came down,
\q1 And darkness was under his feet.
\q1
\v 11 And he rose on the cherub,
\q1 And he flew away and flew on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 12 He made darkness is garment, his hut around him,
\q1 Darkness of water, clouds of dust.\f + Uncertain of translation/text.\f*
\q1
\v 13 From the shining in front of him his clouds passed by,
\q1 Hail and live coals of fire.
\q1
\v 14 And YHWH thunders in the heavens,
\q1 And the Most High gives his voice,
\q1 Hail and live coals of fire.
\q1
\v 15 He sends his arrows and scatters them,
\q1 And he shoots lightning bolts and rouses them.
\q1
\v 16 And the channels of water were seen,
\q1 And the foundations of the earth uncovered from your rebuke, O YHWH,
\q1 From the blowing of the wind of your nose.
\q1
\v 17 He sent from the height, he took me,
\q1 He pulled me out of many waters.
\q1
\v 18 He rescued me from my strong enemy,
\q1 And the one who hated me, for they were stronger than I.
\q1
\v 19 They confronted me in the day of my disaster,
\q1 And YHWH was my support.
\q1
\v 20 And he brought me out to the open space,
\q1 And he delivered me for he delights in me.
\q1
\v 21 YHWH rendered to me according to my righteousness,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 According to the purity of my hands he returned to me.\f + Ps 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 22 For I have kept the ways of YHWH,
\q1 And I have not made myself guilty from my God.\f + Note assertion of innocence.\f*
\q1
\v 23 For all of his judgments are before me,
\q1 And his statutes I have not removed from me.
\q1
\v 24 I have integrity\f + Ps 15:2.\f* with him,
\q1 And I have kept myself from guilt.
\q1
\v 25 And YHWH returned to me according to my righteousness,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 According to the purity of my hand before his eyes.\f + Ps 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 26 With the faithful you are faithful,
\q1 With the reliable man you are reliable.\f + This is a difficult translation to decide on. I chose "reliable" as reflecting a notion of integrity.\f*
\q1
\v 27 With the pure you are pure,
\q1 But with the perverted you prove torturous.
\q1
\v 28 For you save the afflicted people,
\q1 And the haughty eyes you bring down.
\q1
\v 29 For you brighten my lamp,
\q1 YHWH my God lightens my darkness.
\q1
\v 30 For in you I charge a wall,
\q1 And in my God I leap over a wall.
\q1
\v 31 God, his way is complete\f + Ps 15:2.\f*,
\q1 The words of YHWH are refined,
\q1 He is a shield to all who take refuge in him.
\q1
\v 32 For who is God apart from YHWH?
\q1 And who is a rock except our God?
\q1
\v 33 The God who girded me with strength,
\q1 And made my way complete\f + Ps 15:2.\f*.
\q1
\v 34 He made my feet like the deer,
\q1 And on my heights he made me stand.
\q1
\v 35 He trained my hands for battle,
\q1 And my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
\q1
\v 36 And you gave to me a shield of your salvation,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 And your right hand supports me,
\q1 And your gentleness\f + Meaning uncertain.\f* has made me great.
\q1
\v 37 You open wide my steps under me,
\q1 And my ankles do not wobble.\f + Cf. Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1
\v 38 I will pursue my enemies and I wil overtake them,
\q1 And I will not turn back until they are finished.
\q1
\v 39 I will strike them and they will not be able to rise,
\q1 They will fall under my feet.
\q1
\v 40 And you gird me with strength for battle,
\q1 You made those rising up against me bend the knee under me.
\q1
\v 41 And my enemies, you have given to me the back of the neck,
\q1 And those who hate me I silence them.
\q1
\v 42 They cried for help, but there was no one to save,
\q1 To YHWH, but he did not answer them.
\q1
\v 43 And I will grind them down like dust before the wind,
\q1 Like wet clay out in the street I will pour them out.
\q1
\v 44 You bring me to safety from disputes with the peoples,
\q1 you placed me at the head of the nations,
\q1 A people I did not know serves me.
\q1
\v 45 When the ear hears they listen to me,
\q1 Sons of a foreign land feign submission to me.
\q1
\v 46 Sons of a foreign land wither,
\q1 They come out trembling from their dungeons.
\q1
\v 47 YHWH lives, and blessed be my rock.
\q1 May the God of my salvation\f + Ps 24:5.\f* be exalted.
\q1
\v 48 The God who gave me vengeance,
\q1 And he subjugated the peoples under me.
\q1
\v 49 He brought me to safety from my enemies,
\q1 Even from the one who rises up against me you exalted me,
\q1 From the man of violence you delivered me.
\q1
\v 50 Therefore I will praise you among the nations, O YHWH,
\q1 And to your name I will sing praise.
\q1
\v 51 He makes great the salvation of his king,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 And he is faithful to his anointed,
\q1 To David and to his seed forever.
