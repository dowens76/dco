\v 1 A Psalm
\q1 Sing to the Lord a new song,
\q1 For wonders he has done.
\q1 His right hand and his holy arm have accomplished salvation for him.
\q1
\v 2 The Lord has made known his salvation,
\q1 He has revealed his righteousness before the nations.
\q1
\v 3 He has remembered his steadfast love and faithfulness to the house of Israel,
\q1 All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
\q1
\v 4 Shout to the Lord, all the earth,
\q1 Burst forth and shout with joy and sing.
\q1
\v 5 Sing praise to the Lord with the lyre,
\q1 With the lyre and the sound of playing.
\q1
\v 6 With trumpets and the sound of the horn,
\q1 Shout before the King, the Lord.
\q1
\v 7 Let the sea thunder and all which fills it,
\q1 The world and those who dwell in it.
\q1
\v 8 Let the rivers clap their hands,
\q1 Let the mountains sing for joy together.
\q1
\v 9 Before the Lord, for he comes to judge the earth,
\q1 He will judge the world in righteousness
\q1 And the peoples with justice.
