\c 38
\p
\v 1 A psalm of David, for memorial.
\q1
\v 2 O YHWH, do not in your anger reprove me,
\q1 And in your anger chastise me.
\q1
\v 3 For your arrows penetrate me,
\q1 And your hand presses down on me.
\q1
\v 4 There is no sound spot in my flesh from before your curse,
\q1 There is no wholeness in my bones from before my sin.
\q1
\v 5 For my sins have passed over my head,
\q1 Like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
\q1
\v 6 My wounds have become odious and putrefied,
\q1 From before my foolishness.
\q1
\v 7 I am distressed, I stoop very low,
\q1 Every day I walk around in mourning.
\q1
\v 8 For my my loins are filled with burning,
\q1 And there is no soundness in my flesh.
\q1
\v 9 I am powerless and crushed to the extreme,
\q1 I roar from the groaning of my heart.\f + Cf. Pss 15:5; 24:5.\f*
\q1
\v 10 O Lord, all my longing is before you,
\q1 And my sighing is not hidden from you.
\q1
\v 11 My heart beats violently, my strength abandons me,
\q1 And the light of my eyes, even they are not with me.
\q1
\v 12 My friends and my companions stand away from my affliction,
\q1 And those near to me stand far off.
\q1
\v 13 Those who seek my life lay snares,
\q1 And those who seek my harm speak ruin,
\q1 And deceitful things they speak all day.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 14 But I am like a deaf, I do not hear,
\q1 And like a dumb, his mouth does not open.
\q1
\v 15 And I am like a man who does not hear,
\q1 And there is no protest in his mouth.
\q1
\v 16 Because for you O YHWH I wait,
\q1 You will answer me, O Lord my God.
\q1
\v 17 For I have said, lest they rejoice over me,
\q1 When my feet stagger\f + Ps 15:5.\f*, against me they make make great.\f + I am not certain how to render this.\f*
\q1
\v 18 For I am ready for stumbling,
\q1 And my pain is continually before me.
\q1
\v 19 For my guilt I will tell,
\q1 I will be anxious of my sins.
\q1
\v 20 And my enemies of life are numerous,
\q1 And those who hate me without reason are many.
\q1
\v 21 Those who repay evil instead of good,
\q1 They bear a grudge in stead of pursuing good.\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 22 Do not abandon me, O YHWH,
\q1 My God do not be far from me.
\q1
\v 23 Hurry to my help,
\q1 O Lord save me.
