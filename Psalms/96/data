\p
\v 1 Sing to the Lord a new song,
\q1 Sing to the Lord all the earth!
\q1
\v 2 Sing to the Lord, bless his name,
\q1 Make known day by day his salvation.
\q1
\v 3 Recount among the nations his glory,
\q1 Amon all peoples his wonders.
\q1
\v 4 For great is the Lord and greatly to be praised,
\q1 He is to be feard over all gods.
\q1
\v 5 For all the gods of the peoples are worthless,
\q1 And the Lord made the heavens.
\q1
\v 6 Splendor and grandeur are before him,
\q1 Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
\q1
\v 7 Ascribe to the Lord clans of the peoples,
\q1 Ascribe to the Lord honor and strength.
\q1
\v 8 Ascribe to the Lord the honor of his name,
\q1 Lift up an offering and come to his courtyard.
\q1
\v 9 Worship the Lord with the grandeur of holiness,
\q1 Tremble before him, all the earth.
\p
\v 10 Say among the nations, â€œThe Lord reigns!
\q1 Also, the world is established, it will not totter,
\q1 He will judge the peoples justly.
\p
\v 11 Let the heavens rejoice and the earth shout with joy,
\q1 Let the sea and its fullness thunder!
\p
\v 12 Let the open field exult and all which is in it,
\q1 Then all the trees of the forest will shout with joy!
\p
\v 13 Before the Lord, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth,
\q1 He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in faithfulness.
