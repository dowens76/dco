\d Of David
\q1 YHWH is my light and my salvation\f + Ps 24:5.\f*,
\q1 Whom shall I fear?
\q1 YHWH is the fortress of my life,
\q1 Before whom shall I tremble?
\q1
\v 2 When evildoers draw near to me to eat my flesh,
\q1 My adversaries and my enemies,
\q1 They stumble and fall.\f + Cf. Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1
\v 3 Though an army camps against me,
\q1 My heart will not fear,
\q1 Though a war rises up against me,
\q1 In this I am full of confidence.
\q1
\v 4 One thing I ask of YHWH, I seek,
\q1 That I dwell in the house of YHWH all the days of my life,
\q1 To see the kindness of YHWH and to investigate in his temple.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 5 For he will hide me in a shelter on the day of trouble,
\q1 He will hide me in the secrecy of his tent,
\q1 On the rock he will lift me.
\q1
\v 6 And now he lifts my head over my enemies surrounding me,
\q1 And I will sacrifice in his tent\f + Ps 15:1.\f* the sacrifices of a shout of joy,
\q1 I will sing and praise YHWH.
\q1
\v 7 Hear my voice, O YHWH, I cry out,
\q1 Be gracious to me and answer me.
\q1
\v 8 To you my heart says, "Seek my face,"
\q1 Your face, O YHWH, I seek.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 9 Do not hide your face from me,
\q1 Do not turn away your servant in anger
\q1 You have been my help,
\q1 Do not cast me off, do not abandon me, O God of my salvation.\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1
\v 10 If my father and my mother abandon me,
\q1 YHWH will take me in.
\q1
\v 11 Teach me your way, O YHWH,
\q1 And lead me on the level way,
\q1 For the sake of my enemies.
\q1
\v 12 Do not give me to the soul of my adversary,
\q1 For false witnesses\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f* rise up against me,
\q1 and he witnesses to violence.\f + Ps 24:4?\f*
\q1
\v 13 Surely I believe I will see the goodness of YHWH in the land of the living.
\q1
\v 14 Wait for YHWH,
\q1 Be strong and let your heart be strong, and wait for YHWH.\f + Ps 31:25; Deut 31:17; Josh 1:6, 9, 18.\f*
