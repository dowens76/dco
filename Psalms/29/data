\v 1
\d A Psalm of David\f + \fr 29.1: \ft BHS: LXX adds ἐξοδίου σκηνῆς "of the final day of tent" or the Feast of Tabernacles.\f*
\q1 Give\f + \fr 29.1: \ft Qal, Impv., mp, הַב (hypothetical root: יהב, HALOT 236).\f* to Yhwh, O heavenly beings,\f + \fr 29.1: \ft Lit., "sons of gods." BHS: a few Hebrew manuscripts read אילים "mighty trees," and LXX adds ἐνέγκατε τῷ κυρίῳ υἱοὺς κριῶν, "bring to the Lord, sons of rams," which BHS suggests is duplication.\f*
\q1 Give\f + \fr 29.1: \ft Qal, Impv., mp, הַב (hypothetical root: יהב, HALOT 236).\f* to Yhwh glory and strength.
\q1
\v 2 Give\f + \fr 29.2: \ft Qal, Impv., mp, הַב (hypothetical root: יהב, HALOT 236).\f* to Yhwh the glory of his name,
\q1 Worship\f + \fr 29.2: \ft Hisht., Impv., mp, חוה.\f* Yhwh in holy\f + \fr 29.2: \ft BHS: it has been read as קָדְשׁוֹ; cf. LXX and Syriact and Ps 96:9 (LXX and Syriac). This would be harmonization as an interpretive gloss. The sense is the same but the addition further clarifies.\f* grandeur.\f + \fr 29.2: \ft BHS: LXX (Syriac) read ἐν αὐλῇ = בְּחַצְרַת "in the court of." This would refer to the temple, no doubt.\f*
\q1
\v 3 The voice of YHWH is over the waters,
\q1 The God\f + \fr 29.3: \ft BHS: Perhaps to be connected with v. 7. I suppose this means that this fragment of text, "The God of Glory thunders," should be read as part of v. 7, which is unusually short. Without manuscript evidence, it seems best to try to make sense of the verse as it stands.\f* of glory thunders,\f + \fr 29.3: \ft Hiph., Per., 3ms, רעם.\f*
\q1 Yhwh, over many waters.
\q1
\v 4 The voice of Yhwh in strength,
\q1 The voice of Yhwh in glory.
\q1
\v 5 The voice of Yhwh breaks\f + \fr 29.5: \ft Qal, Part., ms, שׁבר.\f* cedars,
\q1 And Yhwh breaks\f + \fr 29.5: \ft Piel, Impf., 3ms, שׁבר, + vav cons.\f* the cedars of Lebanon.
\q1
\v 6 And he makes them skip about\f + \fr 29.6: \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms, + 3mp suffix, רקד.\f* like a calf,
\q1 Lebanon and Sirion like the son of wild oxen.
\q1
\v 7 The voice of Yhwh stirs\f + \fr 29.7: \ft Qal, Part., ms, חצב.\f* flames of fire.
\q1
\v 8 The voice of Yhwh makes the wilderness tremble,\f + \fr 29.8: \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms, חיל.\f*\f + \fr 29.8: \ft BHS: LXX and Syriac put copulative before the first term of this line.\f*
\q1 Yhwh makes the wilderness of Kadesh tremble.\f + \fr 29.8: \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms, חיל.\f*
\q1
\v 9 The voice of Yhwh makes deer\f + \fr 29.9: \ft So ESV; NRSV follows BHS note suggesting that the text be emended to read אֵילִים "mighty trees." See also NET note. The emendation makes better sense of the verb, which is used in the previous verse. However, it is based on an emendation from influence from the previous verse rather than the current verse.\f* give birth,\f + \fr 29.9: \ft Polel, Impf., 3ms, חיל. Unlike the ESV, I retain the same meaning of the verb, following Goldingay (Psalms 1, p. 412, note e). He suggests that the deer here are trembling with fear. he also notes that though formally parallel, this rendering picks up the reference to animals and trees in vv. 5-6.\f*
\q1 And he strips the forest bare,\f + \fr 29.9: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, חשׂף.\f*
\q1 And in his temple everyone says,\f + \fr 29.9: \ft Qal, Part., ms, אמר.\f* "Glory!"
\q1
\v 10 Yhwh sits\f + \fr 29.10: \ft Qal, Per., 3ms, ישׁב.\f* over the heavenly ocean,
\q1 And Yhwh sits\f + \fr 29.10: \ft Qal., Impf., 3ms, ישׁב, + vav cons.\f* as king forever.
\q1
\v 11 Yhwh gives\f + \fr 29.11: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, נתן.\f* strength to his people,
\q1 Yhwh blesses\f + \fr 29.11: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, ברך.\f* his people with peace.
