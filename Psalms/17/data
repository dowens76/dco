\q1 Not on lips of deceit.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 2 From before you let my justice come out,

\q1 You have tested me, you have not found anything,
\q1 I have planned that my mouth may not transgress.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*

\q1 My feet do not waver.\f + Same root (מוט) as Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1
\v 6 I call to you, for you answer me, O God,
\q1 Incline your ear to me, hear my word.
\q1
\v 7 Distinguish your faithful deeds, a savior of those seeking refuge,
\q1 From those who rise up against your right hand.
\q1
\v 8 Keep me like a pupil, daughter of the eye,
\q1 In the shadow of your wings hide me.
\q1
\v 9 From the face of the wicked, these devastate me,
\q1 My enemies will go around me at the risk of my life.

\q1
\v 12 He is like a lion longing to tear to pieces,
\q1 And like a young lion sitting in hiding places.
\q1
\v 13 Arise, O YHWH, walk before his face, force him to his knees,
\q1 Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword.
\q1
\v 14 From men, your hand, O YHWH, from men from the world is their portion in life,
\q1 and with your treasure you fill their belly,
\q1 They have enough children,
\q1 They provide rest, their remainder to their children.
\q1
\v 15 In righteousness I wil see your face,
\q1 I will be satisfied by awaking in your image.\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
