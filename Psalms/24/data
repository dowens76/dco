\c 24
\p
\v 1 A psalm of David.\f + \fr 24.1: \ft LXX adds τῆς μιᾶς σαββάτων, “of the first of the week.” This is likely an addition reflecting the liturgical use of this psalm in Jewish worship. See Kraus, Psalms 1–59, 312; Goldingay, Psalms, 1:356. Cf. Koch, “Tempeleinlassliturgien und Dekaloge,” 59, who suggests there is no evidence of post-exilic use of this psalm as a liturgy.\f*
\q1 To Yhwh belongs the earth and its fullness,
\q2 the world and those who dwell\f + \fr 24.1: \ft Qal, Part, mp, construct, ישׁב. BHS: LXX has καὶ πάντες οἱ κατοικοῦντες.\f* in it.
\q1
\v 2 For\f + \fr 24.2: \ft BHS: omitted in LXX, Symmachus, and Theodotian. While this may reflect a different manuscript tradition, the logic of the move from v. 1 to v. 2 is not altered by its absence. Therefore, I follow the MT in preserving it.\f* he founded it\f + \fr 24.2: \ft Qal, Per., 3ms, + 3fs suffix, יסד.\f* on the seas,
\q2 And on the rivers he established it.\f + \fr 24.2: \ft Piel, Impf., 3ms, +3fs suffix, כון.\f*

\v 3 Who may ascend\f + \fr 24.3: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, עלה.\f* the mountain of YHWH?
\q2 And who may stand\f + \fr 24.3: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, קום.\f* in his holy place?
\q1
\v 4 He who has innocent hands,
\q2 and a pure heart;
\q1 Who does not lift up\f + \fr 24.4: \ft Qal, Per., 3ms, נשׂא.\f* his soul\f + \fr 24.4: \ft The translation of נֶפֶשׁ into the English “soul” is problematic. It may invoke Greek psychology in which the soul is distinct from the body. I do not intend to communicate this (cf. Fredericks, “נֶפֶשׁ (nepeš),” 133). In the OT the word נֶפֶשׁ may be translated in various contexts as “throat,” “neck,” “breath,” “living being,” “people,” “personality,” “life,” “soul,” or “dead soul,” i.e., “corpse” (HALOT 712–13). In this context the word seems to represent the whole person or “the praying self.” In its context it may involve a notion of desire (so Seebass, “נֶפֶשׁ nepeš,” 507), but this involves the orientation of the whole person. Cf. Block, “How Many is God?,” 85–86. Here MT has נַפְשִׁי, “my soul,” while the BHS suggests reading נַפְשׁוֹ, “his soul,” with fragments from Cairo Geniza, some Hebrew manuscripts, and other versions (Codex Alexandrinus, the Peshitta, the Vulgate) (Seremak, Psalm 24 als Text zwischen den Texten, 41). To understand the MT reading, commentators often cite a parallel in Exod 20:7a (// Deut 5:11a): “You shall not lift up the name of YHWH your God to falsehood” (לֹא תִשָּׂא אֶת־שֵׁם־יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ לַשָּׁוְא) (See Anderson, The Book of Psalms, 1:203; Broyles, “Psalms Concerning the Liturgies of Temple Entry,” 250; Goldingay, Psalms, 1:355. More recently, see Imes, “Psalm 24:4 and the Decalogue”.). This apparent parallel shares three terms and an identical clause structure with Ps 24:4: לֹא + נשׂא + לַשָׁוְא. In this reading “my soul” supposedly substitutes for “my name,” corresponding to the “name of YHWH” (Imes, “Psalm 24:4 and the Decalogue,” 6–7.). This reading provides a way to preserve the MT as the lectio difficilior (So Seremak, Psalm 24 als Text zwischen den Texten, 42; Goldingay, Psalms, 355; Imes, “Psalm 24:4 and the Decalogue,” 1.). However, this requires understanding v. 4 to be YHWH’s voice. However, as Alter points out, the question-response structure of this section does not allow for a shift from third-person description to a first person address from YHWH (Alter, Psalms, 82). Also, if “my name” were intended, we may wonder why this was not written. Seremak notes that the י and ו can easily be confused, offering an explanation for the MT reading. However, he concludes that the text cannot be established on text-critical grounds alone, so he favors the MT (Seremak, Psalm 24 als Text zwischen den Texten, 42.). Goldingay points to Ps 25:1, where the psalmist lifts his own soul to YHWH (אֵלֶיךָ יְהוָה נַפְשִׁי אֶשָּא) (Goldingay, Psalms, 1:355.). That could hardly be referring to YHWH’s name. In addition, the language of lifting one’s soul to God in Ps 25:1 finds verbal echoes in Ps 86:4 (אֵלֶיךָ אֲדֹנָי נַפְשִׁי אֶשָּׁא) and 143:8 (אֵלֶיךָ נָשָׂאתִי נַפְשִׁי). The repeated use of this vocabulary suggests the collocation is a stereotyped phrase for worship, which raises the possibility that a pious scribe could have inadvertently harmonized Ps 24:4c with that language. This would account for the presence of the MT reading and make it the lectio facilior. The parallel language from the Decalogue introduces problems that are not easily solved. It is preferably understood as a linguistic parallel for the idiom used there, but it does not seem to offer a valid literary parallel inviting us to read Ps 24:4c in light of the Decalogue. The simpler explanation is that the MT text reflects a scribal error, for the MT reading is too difficult to be interpreted within the context (Kraus, Psalms 1–59, 311; Steingrimsson, Tor der Gerechtigkeit, 70.).\f* to what is false,
\q2 And does not swear\f + \fr 24.4: \ft Niph., Perf., 3ms, שׁבע.\f* deceitfully.\f + \fr 24.4: \ft LXX adds τῷ πλησίον αὐτοῦ “to his neighbor.” This is the sense of the verse, but the LXX reading is likely an interpretive gloss, perhaps under the influence of the same phrase, לְרֵעֵהוּ, in Ps 15:3. Cf. Westermann, The Living Psalms, 277. Westermann prefers the LXX on the basis of the supposition that other commands have dropped out of Psalm 24.\f*

\v 5 He will take up\f + \fr 24.5: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, נשׂא.\f* blessing from YHWH,
\q2 And righteousness from the God of his salvation.

\v 6 This is the generation that seeks him\f + \fr 24.6: \ft Qal, Part., ms, + 3ms suffix, דרשׁ. The singular דֹּרְשָׁו, “that seeks him” of the MT is replaced by the plural form of the participle in a fragment from Cairo Geniza, Qere, and LXX. Kraus argues that we should read this with some Greek manuscripts as דֹרשֵׁי יהוה, “those who seek YHWH,” in part for the sake of meter (Kraus, Psalms 1–59, 311; cf. Westermann, The Living Psalms, 277). This preserves the lectio facilior. The Greek reading may attempt to smooth over meter and create a closer grammatical parallelism with מְבַקְשֵׁי, “those who seek,” in the second line. The same argument applies to Goldingay’s decision to follow Q and read the plural form without adding יהוה (Psalms, 1:356), for it preserves the grammatical parallelism. Therefore the MT reading is preferred.\f*
\q2 Who seek\f + \fr 24.6: \ft Piel, Part., mp, construct, בּקשׁ.\f* your face, (God of)\f + \fr 24.6: \ft Instead of the MT’s פָנֶיךָ, “your face,” LXX omits the suffix, and two medieval Hebrew manuscripts, LXX, and Syriac add a reference to God. The LXX reads τὸ πρόσωπον τοῦ θεοῦ Ιακωβ, “the face of the God of Jacob” (So Kraus, Psalms 1–59, 311; Westermann, The Living Psalms, 277; Craigie, Psalms 1–50, 210; RSV/NRSV/ESV.), while the others read פניך אלהי יעקב, “your face, O God of Jacob.” To complicate this picture further, the Targum has a 3rd person singular suffix, “his face.” The variations in these readings suggest that the ancients struggled with this verse. The Targum reading seems to attempt to smooth over the shift of perspective to second-person address, a factor evident in the lack of a personal pronoun in the LXX version. However, the most significant question concerns the reference to God. Tromp doubts that a reference to God would have been dropped from the text (Tromp, “Jacob in Psalm 24,” 274.). The MT reading, מְבַקְשֵׁי פָנֶיךָ יַעֲקֹב, is reflected in the KJV “that seek thy face, O Jacob.” However, as Kraus notes, this does not fit the context—YHWH is the expected object of the worshipper (Kraus, Psalms 1–59, 311.). One solution is to see an ABA’ pattern in the clause structure, with Jacob referring to the “generation” (This may be reflected in the NASB: “Who seek Your face—even Jacob.” NJPS reverses the order of the words, translating the second line “Jacob, who seek Your presence.” ). Tromp denies that an idealized interpretation of Jacob as “the generation” is appropriate since it goes against the structure of the sentence (Tromp, “Jacob in Psalm 24,” 278.). Instead, he argues that the LXX represents the original text. However, MT reflects a universalizing trend in the Psalter that involved Israel playing an intermediary role between YHWH and the nations (Tromp, “Jacob in Psalm 24,” 281–82.). This cannot be proven, though it may explain the absence of a reference to God where one would expect it. In this case common sense may be the best guide (Tov, Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible, 355–56.). The context (especially v. 3) favors YHWH as the object of the inquiry of worshippers. On the question of whether Jacob is idealized here, we should consider Galling’s claim that v. 6 represents a Beichtspiegel, a self-report or confession on the model of Deut 26:12–15 (Galling, “Der Beichtspiegel,” 170, 174.). This does not seem an appropriate parallel since such confessions, including that found in the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Chapter 125 (ANET 34–36.), are typically cast in the first person. Psalm 24 maintains third-person description throughout. Although it is hard to explain why a reference to deity would have been dropped from the text, it seems preferable to understand that such has taken place.\f* Jacob.
