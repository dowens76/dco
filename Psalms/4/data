\q2 In distress you have given me open space.
\q2 Be gracious to me and hear my prayer!

\v 3 O sons of man, how long will my honor be disgrace?
\q2 [How long] will you love emptiness?
\q2 [How long] will you seek falsehood?\qs Selah
\q1
\v 4 But know that YHWH has distinguished the faithful for himself,
\q2 The Lord will hear when I call to him.
\q1
\v 5\qs Selah

\v 6 Slaughter righteous sacrifices
\q2 And trust in YHWH.

\v 7 Many will say, "Who will show us good?
\q2 Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!"
\q1
\v 8 You have given joy in my heart,
\q2 more than the time when their grain and their wine is great.

\v 9 In peace I both lie down and sleep,
\q2 for you O LORD alone make me dwell in safety.
