\v 21 "I found David my servant,
\q2 With my holy oil I anointed him.
\q1
\v 22 whom my hand established with him,
\q2 Even my arm will strengthen him.
\q1
\v 23 The enemy will not treat him badly
\q1 And the injust will not humiliate him
\q1
\v 24 And I will crush from before him his enemies
\q1 And those who hate him I will strike.
\q1
\v 25 And my faithfulness and my fidelity will be with him,
\q1 And by my name his horn will be exalted.
\q1
\v 26 And I will place his hand on the sea,
\q1 And in the rivers his right hand.
\q1
\v 27 he will call to me, 'You are my father,"
\q1 My God and the rock of my salvation.'
\q1
\v 28 Also I will make him firstborn,
\q1 Highest of the kings of the earth.
\q1
\v 29 Forever my fidelity I will keep him,
\q1 And my covenant will be faithful to him.
\q1
\v 30 And I will establish his seed forever,
\q1 And his throne like the days of the heavens.
\q1
\v 31 If his children forsake my instruction
\q1 And in my judgments they do not go
\q1
\v 32 If my statutes they defile,
\q1 And my commandments they do not keep,
\q1
\v 33 Then I will punish with the rod their transgression,
\q1 And with the wounds of their guilt.
\q1
\v 34 And my fildelity I will not break from them,
\q1 And I will not break with my faithfulness.
\q1
\v 35 I will not defile my covenant,
\q1 And I will not change what departed from my mouth.
\q1
\v 36 Once I swore in my holiness
\q1 If to David I prove a liar.
\q1
\v 37 His seed will be forever,
\q1 His throne like the sun before me.
\q1
\v 38 Like the moon it is established forever,
\q1 And a witness in heaven is faithful. \qs Selah\qs*
