\c 3
\p
\v 1 A Psalm of David; when he fled from Absalom his son.
\q1
\v 2 O Lord, how numerous are my enemies!
\q1 Many are rising up against me!
\q1
\v 3 Many are saying to my soul,
\q1 There is no salvation for him in God.\qs Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 4 But you, O Lord, are a shield around me,
\q1 My glory and the one who lifts my head.
\q1
\v 5 My voice cried out to the Lord,
\q1 And he answered me from his holy hill.\qs Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 6 I laid down and I slept
\q1 I awoke for the Lord supported me.
\q1
\v 7 I will not fear the multitudes of people
\q1 Who all around have set against me.
\q1
\v 8 Rise, O Lord!
\q1 Save me, O my God!
\q1 For you strike all my enemies on the cheek
\q1 The teeth of the wicked you break.
\q1
\v 9 Salvation belongs to the Lord
\q1 Your blessing is on your people.\qs Selah\qs*
