\v 1
\d Of David
\q1 To you, O YHWH, I call,
\q1 My rock, do not be deaf to me,
\q1 Lest you be silent to me,
\q1 And I will be like those going down into the pit.
\q1
\v 2 Hear the voice of my supplication,
\q1 As I cry to you,
\q1 As I lift my hands to the holy of holies.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 3 Do not drag me with the wicked,
\q1 And with those who make trouble,
\q1 Those who speak peace with their neighbors but evil is in their hearts.\f + Ps 15:2-4; 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 4 Give to them according to their work,
\q1 And according to the evil of their deeds
\q1 According to the work of their hands\f + Ps 24:4.\f* give to them,
\q1 Return their doings to them.
\q1
\v 5 For they will not consider the deeds of YHWH,
\q1 And to the work of his hand,\f + Cf. Ps 24:4.\f*
\q1 He will break them down and not build them.
\q1
\v 6 Blessed be YHWH,
\q1 for he hears the voice of my supplication.
\q1
\v 7 YHWH is my help and my shield,
\q1 In him my heart trusts,
\q1 And I am helped, and my heart exults,
\q1 And with my song I praise him.
\q1
\v 8 YHWH is the strength of his people,\f + Emendation; cf. ESV/NRSV/NET.\f*
\q1 And he is the fortress of salvation of his anointed.
\q1
\v 9 Save your people and bless your heritage,
\q1 And shepherd them and carry them forever.
