\c 19

\v 1 For the musical director, a Psalm of David:
\q1
\v 2 The heavens proclaim the glory of God
\q1 And the work of his hands the sky makes known
\q1
\v 3 Day after day they pour out speech
\q1 And night after night they declare knowledge
\q1
\v 4 There is no speech and there are no words
\q1 Their voice is not heard
\q1
\v 5 In all the earth their call goes out
\q1 At the end of the world are their words
\q1 For the sun he placed a tent in them.
\q1
\v 6 It\f + the sun\f* is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber
\q1 It rejoices like a mighty man to run the path
\q1
\v 7 From the ends of the heavens is its rising
\q1 And its circuit is upon their ends
\q1 And there is nothing hidden from its heat.
\q1
\v 8 The instruction of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul
\q1 The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple
\q1
\v 9 The precepts of the Lord are upright, brining joy to the heart
\q1 The commandment of the Lord is pure, giving light to the eyes
\q1
\v 10 The fear of the Lord is pure, standing forever
\q1 The judgments of the Lord are truth, they are righteous all together
\q1
\v 11 They are more desireable than gold and pure gold
\q1 They are sweeter than honey and flowing honey of a honey-comb
\q1
\v 12 Even your servant is instructed by them
\q1 In keeping them there is much reward
\q1
\v 13 Who can discern errors?
\q1 Clear me of the secret\f + sins\f*.\f + Cf. Pss 15, 24.\f*
\q1
\v 14 Also from wickedness withold your servant, let them not rule over me
\q1 Then I shall be complete\f + Cf. Ps 15:2.\f*, and I shall be free from great transgression
\q1
\v 15 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing before you
\q1 O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.
