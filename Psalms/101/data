\c 101
\p
\v 1 A psalm of David
\q1 Of steadfast love and justice I will sing,
\q1 To you, O Lord, I will sing praise.
\q1
\v 2 I will think on the way which is blameless,
\q1 When will you come to me?
\q1 I will walk about in the integrity of my heart,
\q1 In the midst of my house.
\q1
\v 3 I will not set before my eyes a worthless thing,
\q1 The working of deviation I hate,
\q1 It will not cling to me.
\q1
\v 4 A perverted heart will turn aside from me,
\q1 I wil not know evil.
\q1
\v 5 The one who slanders in secret to me I will silence,
\q1 He who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not endure.
\q1
\v 6 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land,
\q1 To the one who dwells with me,
\q1 He who walks in the way of integrity,
\q1 He shall serve me.
\q1
\v 7 He will not dwell in my house who makes deceit,
\q1 He who speaks falsehood will not stand before me.
\q1
\v 8 By morning I will silence all the wicked of the land,
\q1 To cut off from the city of the Lord all those who do evil.
