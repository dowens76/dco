\d To the director, a psalm of David
\q1
\v 2 In you, O YHWH, I seek refuge,
\q1 Do not let me be ashamed forever,
\q1 In your righteousness\f + Ps 24:5.\f* bring me to safety.
\q1
\v 3 Incline your ear to me,
\q1 Quickly rescue me.
\q1 Be to me a rock of refuge,
\q1 A house of strongholds to save me.\f + Ps 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 4 For you are my rock and my stronghold,
\q1 And because of your name lead me and guide me.
\q1
\v 5 Bring me out of the net which they have hidden for me,
\q1 For you are my fortress.
\q1
\v 6 In your hand I entrust my spirit,
\q1 You have redeemed me, O YHWH, God of faithfulness.
\q1
\v 7 I hate\f + NRSV: "you hate."\f* those who keep false nothingness\f + Or idols (so ESV, NRSV, NET). Ps 24:4.\f*
\q1 But I trust in YHWH.
\q1
\v 8 I shout with joy and rejoice in your steadfast love,
\q1 Because you have seen my affliction,
\q1 You have knonw the distresses of my soul.
\q1
\v 9 And you have not shut me in the hand of the enemy,
\q1 You have stood my feet in the open space.
\q1
\v 10 Be gracious to me, O YHWH, for distress is mine,
\q1 My eye is weak with provocation,
\q1 So my life and my inner being.
\q1
\v 11 For my life has come to an end in trouble,
\q1 And my years in groaning.
\q1 In my guilt my strength has tottered,\f + Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1 And my bones have become weak.
\q1
\v 12 From all my enemies I am scorned,
\q1 And to my neighbors exceedlingy...\f + Craigie suggests emendation.\f*
\q1 And trembling to those who know me,
\q1 Those who see me outside flee from me.
\q1
\v 13 I am forgotten like the one who dies from the heart,
\q1 I am like a broken utensil.
\q1
\v 14 For I have heard the rumor of many,
\q1 --Terror is all around!--
\q1 In their conspiring together against me,
\q1 They plan to take my life.\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 15 But I trust in you, O YHWH,
\q1 I have said, "You are my God."
\q1
\v 16 In your hand are my times,
\q1 Deliver me from the had of my enemies and those who pursue me.
\q1
\v 17 Shine your face on your servant,\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1 Save me in your steadfast love.
\q1
\v 18 O YHWH, do not let me be ashamed,
\q1 For I have called to you,
\q1 Let the wicked be ashamed,
\q1 Let them wail to Sheol.
\q1
\v 19 Let the lips of falsehood\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f* be silent,
\q1 Those that speak insolently against the righteous in haughtiness and contempt
\q1
\v 20 How abundant is your goodness,
\q1 Which you have stored up for those who fear you,
\q1 You have done for those who take refuge in you,
\q1 Before the sons of man.\f + Cf. Pss 15 and 24. Seeking refuge in YHWH is to fear him.\f*
\q1
\v 21 You hide them in the secrecy of your face,
\q1 From the slanderers of man,
\q1 You hide them in a shelter,
\q1 From the dispute of tongues.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 22 Blessed be YHWH,
\q1 For he has marvellously shown his steadfast love to me,
\q1 In a beseiged city.
\q1
\v 23 But I said in my haste,
\q1 "I am cut off from before your eyes,"
\q1 Nevertheless you heard the voice of my supplication,
\q1 When I cried to you for help.
\q1
\v 24 Love YHWH, all his faithful ones,
\q1 The reliable ones YHWH protects,
\q1 But he repays the remainder who acts haughtily.
\q1
\v 25 Be strong and let your heart be courageous,\f + Deut 31:7; Josh 1:6, etc.\f*
\q1 All those who wait for YHWH.\f + Ps 27:14; Deut 31:17; Josh 1:6, 9, 18.\f*
