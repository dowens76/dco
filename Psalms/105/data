\c 105
\p
\v 1 Give thanks to the Lord,
\q1 Call on his name,
\q1 Make known among the nations his deeds.
\q1
\v 2 Sing to him,
\q1 Sing praise to him,
\q1 Talk about all of his wonders.
\q1
\v 3 Praise his holy name,
\q1 Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
\q1
\v 4 Seek the Lord and his strength,
\q1 Seek his face continually.
\q1
\v 5 Remember his wonders which he did,
\q1 His signs and the judgements of his mouth.
\q1
\v 6 O seed of Abraham his servant,
\q1 Sons of Jacob his chosen ones!
\q1
\v 7 He is the Lord our God,
\q1 In all the earth are his judgements.
\q1
\v 8 He remembers his covenant forever,
\q1 The word of his command for a thousand generations,
\q1
\v 9 Which he made with Abraham,
\q1 And his oath to Isaac.
\p
\v 10 Which he established for Jacob as a statue,
\q1 To Israel as an eternal covenant.
\p
\v 11 saying, “To you I give the land of Canaan,
\q1 As the territory of your inheritance.
\p
\v 12 When they were few in number,
\q1 As little and sojourners in it.
\p
\v 13 And they went about from nation to nation,
\q1 From kingdom to another people.
\p
\v 14 He did not permit mankind to oppress them,
\q1 And he judged kings on account of them.
\p
\v 15 “Do not touch my anointed ones,
\q1 and to my prophets do no evil!”
\p
\v 16 He called for a famine on the earth,
\q1 all the staff of bread he broke.
\p
\v 17 He sent before them a man,
\q1 As a slave Joseph was sold.
\p
\v 18 His feet were afflicted with fetters,
\q1 Iron came on his neck.
\p
\v 19 Until the time his word came,
\q1 The utterance of the Lord tested him.
\q1
\v 20 The king sent and set him free,
\q1 A ruler of the peoples and he opened to him,
\q1
\v 21 He placed him as lord of his house,
\q1 And ruler over all his possessions.
\q1
\v 22 To tie his princes at his desire,
\q1 And to give wisdom to his elders.
\q1
\v 23 And Israel came to Egypt,
\q1 Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\q1
\v 24 The Lord made his people exceedingly fruitful,
\q1 And he made them more numerous than their foes,
\q1
\v 25 He turned their hearts to hate his people,
\q1 To be crafty with his servants.
\q1
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant,
\q1 Aaron, whom he had chosen.
\q1
\v 27 They placed among them the words of his signs,
\q1 And wonders on the land of Ham.
\q1
\v 28 He send darkness and he made it dark,
\q1 And they were not rebellious against his word.
\q1
\v 29 He turned their waters to blood,
\q1 And he made all their fish die.
\q1
\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs,
\q1 In the chambers of their kings.
\q1
\v 31 He spoke and a swarm came,
\q1 Gnats were in all their borders.
\q1
\v 32 He gave hail for their rain,
\q1 Firey bolts on their land.
\q1
\v 33 He struck their vines and their fig trees,
\q1 And he broke the trees of their territory.
\q1
\v 34 He spoke and locusts came,
\q1 And they were without number.
\q1
\v 35 And they consumed all the vegetation in their land,
\q1 And they consumed the fruit of their ground.
\q1
\v 36 And he struck all the firstborn in the their land,
\q1 The first of all their vigour.
\q1
\v 37 And he brought them out with silver and gold,
\q1 And there was no one among his tribes who stumbled.
\q1
\v 38 Egypt rejoiced when they left,
\q1 For their dread had fallen upon them.
\q1
\v 39 He spread out a cloud for their covering,
\q1 And fire to light the night.
\q1
\v 40 They asked and he brought quail,
\q1 And he satisified them with bread from heaven.
\q1
\v 41 He opened the rock and water gushed out,
\q1 It came as a river in the dryness.
\q1
\v 42 For he remembered his holy word,
\q1 Abraham his servant.
\q1
\v 43 And he brought his people out with rejoicing,
\q1 His chosen ones with singing.
\q1
\v 44 And he gave to them the lands of the nations,
\q1 And they took possession of the toil of the peoples.
\q1
\v 45 In order that they might keep his statutes,
\q1 And keep his laws.
\q1 Praise the Lord!
