\c 102
\p
\v 1 The prayer of the afflicted, when he grows weak and before the Lord pours out his concern.
\q1
\v 2 O Lord, hear my prayer,
\q1 And let my cry for help come to you.
\q1
\v 3 Do not hide your face from me on the day of my distress,
\q1 Incline your ear to me on the day I call, answer me quickly.
\q1
\v 4 For my days finish with smoke,
\q1 And my bones burn like a furnace\f + \ft ?\f* .
\q1
\v 5 Struck down like grass and withered is my heart,
\q1 For I forget to eat my bread.
\q1
\v 6 From the sound of my groaning,
\q1 My bones cling to my flesh.
\q1
\v 7 I am like an owl of the desert,
\q1 I am like a screech owl of the wastelands.
\q1
\v 8 I am watchful and I am like a bird alone on the roof.
\q1
\v 9 All the day my enemies taunt me,
\q1 Those who mock me swear.
\p
\v 10 For I eat ashes like bread,
\q1 And I mix my drink with my tears.
\p
\v 11 Because of your curse and your anger,
\q1 For you lifted me up and threw me.
\p
\v 12 My days are like a shadow stretched out,
\q1 And I wither up like grass.
\p
\v 13 But you, O Lord, are enthroned forever,
\q1 And your mention is from generation to generation.
\p
\v 14 You will arise and have compassion on Zion,
\q1 For it is time to show mercy to her, for the appointed time has come.
\p
\v 15 For your servants are pleased with her stones,
\q1 And have compassion on her dust.
\p
\v 16 And the nations will fear the name of the Lord,
\q1 And all the kings of the earth your glory.
\p
\v 17 For the Lord builds Zion,
\q1 He appears in his glory.
\p
\v 18 He turns to the prayer of the naked,
\q1 And he does not despise their prayer.
\p
\v 19 Let this be written for the following generation,
\q1 And the people to be created will praise the Lord.
\q1
\v 20 That he looked down from the height of his holiness,
\q1 The Lord from heaven looked at the earth.
\q1
\v 21 To hear the groans of the prisoner,
\q1 To set free the sons of death.
\q1
\v 22 To recount in Zion the name of the Lord,
\q1 And his praise in Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 23 When peoples gather together,
\q1 And kingdoms to serve the Lord.
\q1
\v 24 He has answered on the way my strength\f + \ft ?\f* ,
\q1 He has shortened my days.
\q1
\v 25 I say, â€œMy God, do not take me up in the middle of my days,
\q1 Your years are from generation to generation.
\q1
\v 26 Formerly you laid the foundations of the earth,
\q1 And the heavens are the work of your hands.
\q1
\v 27 They will perish but you will stand,
\q1 And all of them like a garment will wear out,
\q1 Like a garment you will change and they will change.
\q1
\v 28 And you are
\q1 And your years are not completed.
\q1
\v 29 The children of your servants will dwell,
\q1 And their seed will be established before you.
