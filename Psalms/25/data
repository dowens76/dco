\d Of David
\q1 To you, O YHWH, I lift up my soul.
\q1
\v 2 My God, in you I trust,
\q1 Let me know be ashamed,
\q1 Do not let my enemies rejoice over me.
\q1
\v 3 Also all those who wait for you, let them not be ashamed,
\q1 Let those be ashamed who deal faithlessly without cause.
\q1
\v 4 Make known to me your ways, O YHWH,
\q1 Teach me your way.
\q1
\v 5 Lead me in your truth and teach me,
\q1 For you are the God of my salvation,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 For you I wait all day long.
\q1
\v 6 Remember your mercy, O YHWH, and your steadfast love,
\q1 For they are from of old.
\q1
\v 7 The sins of my youth and my transgressions, do not remember,
\q1 According to your steadfast love remember me,
\q1 For the sake of your goodness, O YHWH.\f + Cf. Ps 32.\f*
\q1
\v 8 Good and upright is YHWH,
\q1 Therefore he teaches sinners in the way.
\q1
\v 9 He leads the humble in justice,
\q1 And he teaches the humble his way.
\q1
\v 10 All the ways of YHWH are steadfast love and fidelity,
\q1 To those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
\q1
\v 11 For the sake of your name, O YHWH,
\q1 Forgive my guilt, for it is great.
\q1
\v 12 Who is this, the man who fears YHWH?
\q1 He will teach themin the way he will choose.
\q1
\v 13 His life will dwell in goodness,
\q1 And his seed will inherit the land.
\q1
\v 14 The counsel of YHWH is for those who fear him,\f + Ps 15:1, 24:3?\f*
\q1 And his covenant to make known to him.
\q1
\v 15 My eyes are ever toward YHWH,
\q1 For he brings my feet out of the net.
\q1
\v 16 Turn to me and be gracious to me,
\q1 For I am lonely and poor.
\q1
\v 17 Make wide the distresses of my heart,
\q1 From my afflictions bring me out.
\q1
\v 18 See my affliction and my trouble,
\q1 And pardon all my sins.\f + Ps 32.\f*
\q1
\v 19 See my foes, that they are numerous,
\q1 And the hatred of violence they hate me.
\q1
\v 20 Guard my life and deliver me,
\q1 Let me not be ashamed, for I take refuge in you.
\q1
\v 21 May integrity\f + Ps 15:2.\f* and uprightness keep me,
\q1 For I wait for you.
\q1
\v 22 Redeem Israel, O God,
\q1 From all its troubles.
