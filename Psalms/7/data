\v 1
\d A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to YHWH according to the words of Cush Son of my Right Hand (or: the Benjamite)
\q1
\v 2 YHWH, my God, in you I seek refuge,
\q1 Save me from all those who pursue me and rescue me.
\q1
\v 3 Lest he tear me in pieces like a lion,
\q1 He tears away and there is no one to save.
\q1
\v 4 O YHWH, my God, if I have done this,
\q1 If there is injustice in my hands\f + Ps 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 5 If I have rendered evil to the one at peace with me,\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1 And I have plundered the one hostile to me without cause,
\q1
\v 6 May the enemy pursue me and may he overtake and trample my life to the ground,
\q1 And my glory to the dust let him settle.\qs Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 7 Arise, O YHWH, in your anger,
\q1 Be lifted up against the fury of my enemies,
\q1 And awake, for me\f + ESV: "awake for me; you have appointed a judgment."; NRSV: "my God."\f* you have appointed a judgment.
\q1
\v 8 And let the assembly of the peoples surround you,
\q1 And return on high over it.
\q1
\v 9 YHWH will judge the peoples,
\q1 Judge me, O YHWH, according to my righteousness and according to my blamelessness in me.\f + Ps 15:2 two lexemes.\f*
\q1
\v 10 O let the evil of the wicked come to an end
\q1 And may you establish the righteous
\q1 And the one who tests hearts and the inner man, O righteous God.
\q1
\v 11 My shield is on\f + ? Preposition's role is uncertain?\f* God,
\q1 The one who saves the upright of heart.
\q1
\v 12 God is a righteous judge,
\q1 And a God who passes sentence\f + Holladay, p. 91.\f* every day.
\q1
\v 13 If one does not repent he will sharpen his sword,
\q1 His bow he has drawn and readies.
\q1
\v 14 And for him he has readied weapons of death,
\q1 His arrows he makes to burn.
\q1
\v 15 Behold he is pregnant with trouble,
\q1 And conceives disaster,
\q1 And gives birth to falsehood.\f + Ps 24:4?\f*
\q1
\v 16 He excavates a cistern and digs it,
\q1 And he falls in the pit he makes.
\q1
\v 17 His disaster will turn on his head,
\q1 And on the crown of his head his violence will go down.
\q1
\v 18 I will praise YHWH according to his righteousness,
\q1 And I will praise the name of YHWH Most High.
