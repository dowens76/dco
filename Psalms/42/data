\pc To the director, a Maskil of the sons of Korah
\q1
\v 2 Like a deer longing for streams of water,
\q1 So my soul longs for you, O God.
\q1
\v 3 My soul thirsts for God,
\q1 For the living God,
\q1 When shall I come and see the face of God?\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 4 My tears have been my bread by day and night
\q1 When saying to me all day, "where is your God?"\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 5 These I will remember, and I pour out my soul over myself,
\q1 When I would pass through in the throng,
\q1 I would walk to the house of God,\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1 With a shout of joy and praise,
\q1 Celebrating a procession.
\q1
\v 6 Why are you melting away, O my soul, and unsteady in me,
\q1 Wait for God, for I will again praise him for the helping deeds of his face,
\q1
\v 7 my God.
\q1 My soul melts away in me,
\q1 Therefore I will remember you,
\q1 From the land of Jordan and Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
\q1
\v 8 Deep calls to deep,
\q1 At the sound of your water spouts,
\q1 All your breakers and your waves have passed over me.
\q1
\v 9 By day YHWH commands his steadfast love,
\q1 And by night his song is with me,
\q1 A prayer to the God of my life.
\q1
\v 10 I will say to God, my rock,
\q1 Why have you forgotten me?
\q1 Why shall I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\q1
\v 11 With shattering in my bones my enemies taunt me,\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 12 Why are you melting away, O my soul, and unsteady in me,
\q1 Wait for God, for I will again praise him for the helping deeds of his face, my God.
