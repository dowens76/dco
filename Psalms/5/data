\c 5

\v 1 For the music director, for the flutes, a psalm of David
\q1
\v 2 Listen to my words, O LORD,
\q2 Pay attention to my groaning!
\q1
\v 3 Pay attention to my cry for help, my King and my God,
\q2 For to you do I pray.
\q1
\v 4 O LORD in the morning you hear my voice,
\q2 In the morning I prepare (?) for you and watch.
\q1
\v 5 For, you are not a God who desires wickedness,
\q2 Nor may evil sojourn with you.
\q1
\v 6 Fools will not stand before your eyes,
\q2 You hate all those who make trouble.
\q1
\v 7 You destroy those who speak a lie
\q2 A man of blood and deceit YHWH loathes.
\q1
\v 8 But I, through the abundance of your mercy, will come to your house,
\q2 I will worship at your holy temple in fear of you.
\q1
\v 9 O LORD, lead me in your righteousness because of my enemy,
\q2 Make straight your way before me.
\q1
\v 10 For there is no standing firm in their mouths
\q2 In their midst is ruin,
\q1 Their throat is an open grave,
\q2 Their tongues are slippery.
\q1
\v 11 O God, hold them guilty,
\q2 Let them fall by their counsel,
\q1 By the abundance of their wickedness scatter them,
\q2 For they are obstinate against you.
\q1
\v 12 But let all of those who seek refuge in you rejoice,
\q2 Let them shout with joy forever.
\q1 And you will cover them
\q2 And let those who love your name rejoice in you.
\q1
\v 13 For you bless the righteous, O YHWH,
\q2 You surround him with favor as a shield.
