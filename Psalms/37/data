\v 1
\d Of David.
\q1 Do not be incensed by those who do evil,
\q2 Do not be envious of those who do injustice.
\q1
\v 2 For like grass they will dry up quickly
\q2 And like fresh green plants they will wither.
\q1
\v 3 Trust in YHWH and do good,
\q2 Inhabit the land and tend to faithfulness.
\q1
\v 4 And take pleasure in YHWH
\q2 And he will give to you the desires of your heart.
\q1
\v 5 Roll\f + \ft Investigate this.\f* your way to YHWH,
\q2 And trust in him,
\q3 And he will act.\f + \ft Without object - see Deuteronomy. M. Patton: increasing number of promises after imperatives.\f*
\q1
\v 6 He will bring out your righteousness like the light
\q2 And your justice like the noon.
\q1
\v 7 Be still\f + \ft Qal imperative of \ft דמם\ft .\f* before YWH
\q2 and wait\f + \ft BHS suggests reading hiphil of \ft יָחַל\ft ; MT: hithpael of \ft חיל\ft .\f* for him,
\q1 Do not be incensed\f + \ft See v. 1.\f* by the one who succeeds\f + \ft Hiphil of \ft צלח\ft .\f* in his way,\f + \ft Deut 28:29.\f*
\q2 Over the man who carries out schemes.
\q1
\v 8 Leave aside\f + \ft Hiphil of \ft רפה\ft . HALOT 1277: "release from."\f* anger and abandon rage,
\q2 Do not be incensed---it only brings evil.\f + \ft Hiphil of \ft רעע\ft .\f*
\q1
\v 9 For those who do evil will be cut off
\q2 But those who wait on the YHWH will inherit the land.
\q1
\v 10 But a little longer and the wicked will be no more,
\q2 And you will look closely at his\f + \ft Hithpolel of \ft בין\ft .\f* place, but he will be no more.
\q1
\v 11 And the humble ones will inherit the land,
\q2 And they will take pleasure\f + \ft See v. 4.\f* in an abundance of peace.
\q1
\v 12 The wicked plots against the righteous,
\q2 And he gnashes his teeth at him.\f + \ft Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 13 The Lord laughs at him,\f + \ft Ps 2:4 has same verb for laughing.\f*
\q2 For he sees that his day will come.
\q1
\v 14 The wicked draw a sword
\q2 and draw their bow,\f + \ft See Ps 11:2.\f*
\q1 To make the poor and needy fall,
\q2 To slaughter those whose way is upright.\f + \ft Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 15 Their sword will enter their own heart,
\q2 And their bows will be broken.
\q1
\v 16 Better is what little belongs to the righteous
\q2 than the wealth (turmoil)\f + \ft Word play?\f* of many wicked men.
\q1
\v 17 For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
\q2 But YHWH supports the righteous.
\q1
\v 18 YHWH knows the days of the blameless,\f + \ft Ps 15:2.\f*
\q2 And their inheritance will be forever.
\q1
\v 19 They will not be ashamed in evil times,
\q2 And in days of hunger they will eat their fill.
\q1
\v 20 For the wicked will perish,
\q2 And the enemies of YHWH like the glory of pastures,
\q3 They vanish, in smoke they vanish.
\q1
\v 21 The wicked borrow and they do not repay,
\q2 But the righteous is gracious and gives.
\q1
\v 22 For his\f + \ft This asumes YHWH as referent. But it could be the righteous of v. 21.\f* blessed ones will inherit the land,
\q1 And the ones cursed by him will be cut off.
\q1
\v 23 By YHWH the steps\f + \ft Pathway: cf. Ps 15:5.\f* of the young man are established,\f + \ft Polal of \ft כון\ft .\f*
\q1 And in his way he delights.
\q1
\v 24 Though he fall he will not be hurled down,\f + \ft Hophal of \ft טול\ft .\f*
\q2 For YHWH supports his hand.\f + \ft Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1
\v 25 I have been young, also I have become old,
\q2 And I have not seen the righteous abandoned,
\q2 And his seed seeking bread.
\q1
\v 26 Every day he is gracious and lending,\f + \ft Ps 15:5. See v. 21.\f*
\q2 And his seed becomes a blessing.\f + \ft This clause lacks a verb. But the lamed preposition can express a notion of finality (Jouon par 133d) and be paired with the verb hyh to express the notion of becoming, of a product (Williams par 278), or of a lamed of purpose (IBHS 11.2.10.d). Therefore the notion of "becoming" is implied in the preposition, though there is no verb.\f*
\q1
\v 27 Turn aside from evil and do good,
\q2 And you will\f + \ft GKC 110.f: "The imperative in logical dependence upon a preceding imperative, jussive (or cohortative), or an interrogative sentence, serves to express the distinct assurance or promise that an action or state will ensue as the certain consequence of a previous action."\f* dwell\f + \ft Check out use of shakan - usually of YHWH or his tabernacle.\f* forever.
\q1
\v 28 For YHWH loves justice,\f + \ft Ps 11.\f*
\q2 And he will not abandon his faithful ones,
\q1 They are kept forever,
\q2 But the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
\q1
\v 29 The righteous will inherit the land,
\q2 And they will dwell in it forever.
\q1
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous utters\f + \ft Imperfect of \ft הגה\ft . Cf. Ps 1:2.\f* wisdom,
\q2 And his tongue speaks justice.\f + \ft Ps 15:2; 24:4. Check out mishpat as object of diber. Judicial judgment?\f*
\q1
\v 31 The instruction of his God is in his heart,\f + \ft Ps 1, 19; Cf. Ps 24:4.\f*
\q2 His steps will not stagger.\f + \ft Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1
\v 32 A wicked man lies in wait\f + \ft HALOT 1044.\f* for the righteous,
\q2 and seeks to put him to death.\f + \ft Ps 24:4?\f*
\q1
\v 33 YHWH will not abandon him into his hand,
\q2 And he will not cause him to be condemned\f + \ft Hiphil imperfect of \ft רשׁע\ft .\f* in his judgment.\f + \ft NRSV/ESV: when "brought to trial."\f*
\q1
\v 34 Wait for YHWH and keep his way,
\q2 And he will raise you up to possess the land,
\q3 When the wicked are cut off you will see.
\q1
\v 35 I have seen the wicked exultant,\f + \ft Following LXX and BHS emmendation to read \ft עַלִיץ\ft .\f*
\q2 And one who raises himself\f + \ft Following LXX.\f* like a leafy cedar\f + \ft Following LXX.\f* tree.
\q1
\v 36 And then he passes on,\f + \ft So Alter, p. 133.\f* and behold, he is not there,
\q2 And I have sought for him but he is not found.\f + \ft "Not found" covenant curse? M. Patton.\f*
\q1
\v 37 Watch the blameless and see the upright,
\q2 For there is a future for the man of peace.\f + \ft Ps 24:4? Man of peace vs. man of violence.\f*
\q1
\v 38 But the rebellious are destroyed together,
\q2 The future of the wicked is cut off.
\q1
\v 39 But the deliverance of the righteous is from YHWH,
\q2 Their fortress in a time of distress.
\q1
\v 40 And YHWH will help them and save them,
\q2 He will save them from the wicked,
\q1 And he will deliver them
\q2 for they seek refuge in him.
