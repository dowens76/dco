\v 2 I waited\f + \fr 40.2: \ft Piel, Inf. Abs., קוה.\f* patiently\f + \fr 40.2: \ft Piel, Per., 1cs, קוה.\f* for\f + \fr 40.2: \ft BHS: A few Hebrew manuscripts add אֶל.\f* Yhwh,
\q1 And he turned\f + \fr 40.2: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, + vav cons., נטה.\f* to me,
\q1 And he heard\f + \fr 40.2: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, + vav cons., שמע.\f* my cry for help.
\q1
\v 3 He brought me up\f + \fr 40.3: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, + vav cons., 1cs suffix, עלה.\f* from the pit of desolation, from the mud\f + \fr 40.3: \ft BHS: LXX and Syric add copula before.\f*,
\q1 And he stood\f + \fr 40.3: \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms, +vav cons., קום.\f* my feet on a rock,
\q1 He made my steps secure\f + \fr 40.3: \ft Polel, Per., 3ms, כון.\f*\f + \fr 40.3: \ft BHS: LXX, Aquila, Symmachus, and Syriac put copula before.\f*.
\q1
\v 4 And he gave\f + \fr 40.4: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, נתן.\f* in my mouth a new song,
\q1 Praise to our God,
\q1 Many will see\f + \fr 40.4: \ft Qal, Impf., 3cp, ראה.\f* and fear\f + \fr 40.4: \ft Qal, Impf., 3mp, + vav conj., ירא.\f*,
\q1 And they will trust\f + \fr 40.4: \ft Qal, Impf., 3mp, + vav conj., בטח.\f* in Yhwh.
\q1
\v 5 Happy is the man who makes\f + \fr 40.5: \ft Qal, Per., 3ms, שׂים.\f* YHWH his trust,
\q1 And does not turn\f + \fr 40.5: \ft Qal, Per, 3ms, פנה.\f* to the afflictor, ***and the one entangled in falsehood.\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1
\v 6 You have done many things, O YHWH my God,
\q1 Your marvellous deeds and your plans for us.
\q1 There is no one to compare to you,
\q1 I will proclaim and tell,
\q1 They are too numerous to count.
\q1
\v 7 Sacrifice and offering you have not desired,
\q1 You have dug ears for me,
\q1 Burnt offering and sin offering you have not demanded.
\q1
\v 8 Then I said, "Behold, I have come,
\q1 In the scroll of the book is written for me.
\q1
\v 9 To do you your desire, O my God, is my I delight,
\q1 And your instruction is in my inward parts.\f + Ps 24:4?\f*
\q1
\v 10 I have made known success/rightness in the great assembly,
\q1 Behold my lips I do not hold back,\f + Ps 15:2; 24:4.\f*
\q1 O YHWH, you know.
\q1
\v 11 Your righteousness I have not covered in my heart,
\q1 Your faithfulness and your salvation I have spoken,
\q1 I have not hidden your steadfast love and reliability to the great assembly.
\q1
\v 12 You, O YHWH, do not withhold your mercy from me,
\q1 May your steadfast love and reliability keep me continually.
\q1
\v 13 For evils encompass me without number,
\q1 My sins overtake me and I am not able to see,
\q1 They are more numerous than the hairs of my head,
\q1 And my heart abandons me.\f + Cf. Pss 15 and 24.\f*
\q1
\v 14 Be pleased, O YHWH, to rescue me,
\q1 O YHWH hurry to my aid!
\q1
\v 15 May they be ashamed and put to shame together, they seek my life, to snatch it away,
\q1 Let them shrink back,
\q1 And let them be ashamed, those who take pleasure in my harm.\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 16 Let them shudder because of their shame,
\q1 Those who say to me, "Aha, aha!"
\q1
\v 17 Let them rejoice and be glad in you, all those who seek you,
\q1 Let them say continually, "YHWH is great!" those who love your salvation.
\q1
\v 18 But I am poor and needy,
\q1 May the Lord consider me!
\q1 You are my help and the one who brings me to safety,
\q1 My God, do not delay!
