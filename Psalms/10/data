\v 1 Why O YHWH do you stand far away?
\q1 You hide in times of distress?
\q1
\v 2 In haughtiness the wicked pursue the poor\f + Ps 15:5ab.\f*,
\q1 Let them be captured in the schemes, this they devise\f + Ps 15:3.\f*.
\q1
\v 3 For the wicked praises the desire of his soul,
\q1 And the one who makes his cut (of profit) curses, disdains YHWH\f + Ps 15:5ab.\f*.
\q1
\v 4 The wicked according to the height of his face (arrogance?) does not seek,
\q1 "There is no god" are all his plans.
\q1
\v 5 His ways are firm at all times,
\q1 Your judgments are higher than him,
\q1 All his enemies, he blows heavily at them.
\q1
\v 6 He says in his heart, "I will not totter,"\f + Ps 15:5c.\f*
\q1 Generation by generation in which no in evil.
\q1
\v 7 His mouth is full of curse and deceit and oppression,\f + Ps 15:2, 3, 5; 24:4.\f*
\q1 Under his tongue are disaster and harm.
\q1
\v 8 He sits in ambush in settlements,
\q1 In hiding places he kills the innocent,
\q1 His eyes hide for the unfortunate person.
\q1
\v 9 He lies in ambush in a hiding place like a lion in the thicket,
\q1 He lies in ambush to ravish the poor,\f + Ps 15:5ab.\f*
\q1 He seizes the poor by dragging him off in his net.
\q1
\v 10 He stoops\f + So NRSV; ESV/NET change subject to "the helpless."\f*, he crouches,
\q1 and the unfortunate fall by his might.
\q1
\v 11 He says in his heart\f + Ps 15:2.\f* "God has forgotten,
\q1 He hides his face, he does not see forever.
\q1
\v 12 Arise, O YHWH,
\q1 O God lift your hand,
\q1 Do not forget the poor.
\q1
\v 13 Because of what does the wicked disdain God,
\q1 He says in his heart\f + Ps 15:2.\f* you will not examine?
\q1
\v 14 You see that you look at distress and irritation,
\q1 To give in your hands
\q1 On you the unfortunate abandons,
\q1 You are the helper of the orphan.
\q1
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil,
\q1 You will examine his wickedness, you do not find.
\q1
\v 16 YHWH is King forever and ever,
\q1 The nations have perished from his land.
\q1
\v 17 O YHWH, you have heard the desire of the poor,
\q1 You establish their heart,
\q1 You make your ears attentive.
\q1
\v 18 To judge the orphan and oppressed,
\q1 Not again will man from the earth terrify.
