\v 1 To the director, of David.
\q1 The foolish says in his heart, there is no God,
\q1 They ruin, they do the abominable, there is no one who does good
\q1
\v 2 YHWH from heaven looks down on the children of man,
\q1 To see, is there a prudent one, who seeks God?
\q1
\v 3 All have turned aside,
\q1 together they are corrupted
\q1 No one does good,
\q1 Not even one.
\q1
\v 4 Do they not know, all those who do iniquity?
\q1 Those who eat my people, they eat bread,
\q1 They do not call to YHWH.
\q1
\v 5 There they tremble,
\q1 For God is with the generation\f + Ps 24:6.\f* of the righteous.
\q1
\v 6 The scheme of the poor they shame,
\q1 But YHWH is their refuge.

\v 7 O\f + \fr 14.7: \ft On מִי יִתֵן as stereotyped expression of wish, see GKC 151a-b.\f* that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!
\q1 When YHWH returns the captivity of his people,
\q1 Jacob will shout with joy, Israel will rejoice.
