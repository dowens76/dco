\v 1
\d To the choirmaster; according to the doe of the dawn; a psalm of David.
\q1
\v 2 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
\q2 Why are you far from my salvation, the words of my groaning?
\q1
\v 3 My God, I call by day and you do not answer
\q2 And by night but there is no rest for me.
\q1
\v 4 But you are holy
\q2 Dwelling\f + \ft What does this mean? ESV: "enthroned" \f* the praises of Israel.
\q1
\v 5 In you our fathers trusted\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 3, c p\f*
\q2 They trusted and you brought them to safety.
\q1
\v 6 To you they cried out and were saved
\q2 In you they trusted and they were not ashamed.
\q1
\v 7 But I am a worm and not a man
\q2 The scorn of mankind and despised by people.
\q1
\v 8 Everyone who sees me ridicules me
\q2 They make a wry mouth, they shake their head.
\q1
\v 9 "Roll to YHWH\f + \ft As in trust.\f*, let him deliver him,
\q2 Let him save him for he delights in him."
\q1
\v 10 But you drew me from the womb,
\q2 You made me trust at the breasts of my mother.
\q1
\v 11 On you I was thrown from the womb,
\q2 From the belly of my mother you have been my God.
\q1
\v 12 Do not be far from me for trouble is near,
\q2 For there is no helper.
\q1
\v 13 Many young bulls surround me,
\q2 Strong ones of Bashan surround me.
\q1
\v 14 They open their mouths against me,
\q2 A lion tearing in pieces and roaring.
\q1
\v 15 Like water I am poured out,
\q2 And all my bones are separated from each other
\q1 My heart is like wax
\q2 It melts in the midst of my belly.
\q1
\v 16 My strength is dried up like pottery
\q2 And my tongue clings to my palate,
\q1 And you put me onto the the dusth of death.
\q1
\v 17 For dogs have surrounded me,
\q2 The gathering of the wicked surrounds me
\q1 Like a lion, my hands and feet.
\q1
\v 18 I count all my bones,
\q2 They gaze and look at me.
\q1
\v 19 They divide my garments between them,
\q2 And for my clothes they let fall a lot.
\q1
\v 20 But you, O Lord, do not be distant!
\q2 O my strength, hurry to my help!
\q1
\v 21 Deliver my soul from the sword,
\q2 My lonely soul from the hand of the dog!
\q1
\v 22 Save me from the mouth of the lion,
\q2 And from the horns of the wild ox you have answered me\f + \ft Check textual variants.\f*
\q1
\v 23 I will recount your name to my brothers
\q2 In the midst of the congregation I will praise you.
\q1
\v 24 Those who fear the Lord, praise him!
\q2 All the seed of Jacob, honor him!
\q1 And fear him, all seed of Israel!
\q1
\v 25 For he has not despised nor detested
\q2 the affliction of the afflicted,
\q1 And he has not hidden his face from him,
\q2 But when he cried for help he heard him.
\q1
\v 26 From you is my praise in the great congregation,
\q2 My vows I will complete before those who fear him
\q1
\v 27 The afflicted will eat and be satisfied,
\q2 Those who seek him will praise the Lord;
\q1 May your hearts live forever!
\q1
\v 28 They shall remember and turn to the Lord, all the ends of the earth
\q1 They will worship before you, all the clans of the nations
\q1
\v 29 For kingship belongs to the Lord,
\q2 And he rules ove the nations.
\q1
\v 30 They eat and worship, all the fat of the earth,
\q2 Before him they kneel, all those who go down to the dust,
\q2 And his life he cannot keep alive.
\q1
\v 31 Seed will serve him,
\q2 It will be told of the Lord for the generation.
\q1
\v 32 They will come and report his righteousness
\q2 To a people being born that he has done it.
