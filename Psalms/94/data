\c 94
\p
\v 1 God of vengeance, O Lord,
\q1 God of vengeance shine!
\q1
\v 2 Rise, O Judge of the earth,
\q1 Return reprisal on the haughty.
\q1
\v 3 How long will the wicked, O Lord,
\q1 How long will the wicked exult?
\q1
\v 4 They bubble forth, the speak insolently,
\q1 All evil-doers boast.
\q1
\v 5 Your people, O Lord, they crush,
\q1 And your inheritance they oppress.
\q1
\v 6 The widow and the sojourner they kill,
\q1 And the orphan they kill.
\q1
\v 7 And they say, “The Lord does not see,
\q1 And the God of Jacob does not understand.”
\q1
\v 8 Understand, O stupid ones among the people,
\q1 And fools, when will you consider?
\q1
\v 9 The one who planted the ear, does he not hear?
\q1 Or he who formed the eye does he not see?
\p
\v 10 He who rebukes the nations, does he not reprove?
\q1 He who teaches man knowledge,
\p
\v 11 The Lord knows the thoughts of man
\q1 That they are breath.
\p
\v 12 Blessed is the man whom you rebuke, O Lord,
\q1 Whom you teach from your law.
\p
\v 13 To provide peace for him from the days of trouble,
\q1 Until a pit is dug for the wicked.
\p
\v 14 For the Lord will not abandon his people,
\q1 And his inheritance he will not forsake.
\p
\v 15 For to the righteous justice will return,
\q1 And after it all the upright of heart.
\p
\v 16 Who rises for me with the wicked?
\q1 Who stands for me with evil-doers?
\p
\v 17 If the Lord had not been my help,
\q1 In a little while my life would have lived in silence.
\p
\v 18 When I said, “My foot stumbles,”
\q1 Your steadfast love, O Lord, supported me.
\p
\v 19 In the multitude of me disquieting thoughts in my inward parts,
\q1 Your consolations treat my soul fondly.
\q1
\v 20 Are the thrones of greed allied with you,
\q1 Those who form disaster by statute?
\q1
\v 21 They band together against the life of the righteous,
\q1 And the innocent they condemn to death.
\q1
\v 22 The Lord is my refuge,
\q1 And my God the rock of my refuge.
\q1
\v 23 He will return on them their injustice,
\q1 And for their wickedness he will silence them,
\q1 The Lord our God will silence them.
