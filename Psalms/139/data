\v 1 For the choir director. A Psalm of David
\q1 O LORD, you have examined me
\q1 and you know,
\q1
\v 2 You know my sitting and my rising,
\q1 You understand my thoughts from afar.
\q1
\v 3 My ways and my lying down you have measured,
\q1 And you are familiar with all my ways.
\q1
\v 4 For there is no word on my tongue,
\q1 Behold you, O LORD, know all of it!
\q1
\v 5 From behind and in front you enclose me,
\q1 You place a hand upon me.
\q1
\v 6 This knowledge is too wonderful for me,
\q1 It is unattainable, I cannot grasp it.
\q1
\v 7 Where shall I go from your Spirit?
\q1 Where shall I flee from your face?
\q1
\v 8 If I climb up to the heavens you are there,
\q1 I spread out a couch in Sheol, behold you are there!
\q1
\v 9 I lift up the wings of the dawn,
\q1 I dwell at the farthest sea,
\q1
\v 10 Even there your hand will lead me,
\q1 Your right hand will hold me fast.
\q1
\v 11 And I will say, "Surely the darkness will cover me,
\q1 And the night a light around me."
\q1
\v 12 Even the darkness is not dark for you,
\q1 And night is bright like day, Darkness is as light.
\q1
\v 13 For you produced my inward parts,
\q1 You shaped me in my mother's womb.
\q1
\v 14 I praise you for I am fearfully distinguished,
\q1 Marvelous are your works,
\q1 My soul knows it very well.
\q1
\v 15 My bones were not hidden from you,
\q1 When I was made in secret,
\q1 I was woven in the lowest parts of the earth.
\q1
\v 16 Your eyes saw my unformed embryo,
\q1 In your book all of them are written,
\q1 The days formed (for me),
\q1 And there was not one of them.
\q1
\v 17 How precious are your thoughts to me,
\q1 How numerous is the sum of them!
\q1
\v 18 I count them, they are more numerous than the sand,
\q1 I awake, and I am still with you.
\q1
\v 19 If you would kill the wicked, O God,
\q1 Let men of blood depart from me!
\q1
\v 20 Who speak of you with an evil plan,
\q1 Your enemies take your name in falsehood.
\q1
\v 21 Is it not true that those who hate you I hate?
\q1 And those who rise up against you I loathe?
\q1
\v 22 With complete hatred I hate them,
\q1 They are enemies to me.
\q1
\v 23 Examine me, O God, know my heart,
\q1 Test me and know my disquieting thoughts.
\q1
\v 24 And see if there is a way of pain in me,
\q1 And lead me in the way everlasting.
