\v 1
\d To the director, with string music, accorindg to the eighth, a psalm of David.
\q1
\v 2 Oh YHWH, do not in your anger reprove me
\q1 And do not in your anger chastise me.
\q1
\v 3 Be gracious to me, O YHWH, for I am frail.
\q1 Heal me, O YHWH, for my bones are terrified.
\q1
\v 4 And my soul is terrified exceedingly
\q1 But you O YHWH how long?
\q1
\v 5 Turn, O YHWH, deliver my life,
\q1 Save me for the sake of your steadfast love.
\q1
\v 6 For there is in death no mention of you,
\q1 In Sheol who will praise you?
\q1
\v 7 I grow tired in my groan,
\q1 I swim all night long in my bed,
\q1 In my tears I drench my couch.
\q1
\v 8 My eye becomes weak from irritation,
\q1 It grows weak because of all of my enemies.
\q1
\v 9 Depart from me, evildoers,
\q1 For YHWH has heard the voice of my weeping.
\q1
\v 10 YHWH has heard my supplication,
\q1 YHWH has received my prayer.
\q1
\v 11 They will be ashamed and exceedingly terrified, all my enemies,
\q1 They will return and be ashamed suddenly.
