\c 43
\q1
\v 1 Vindicate me, O God, and dispute my case with a nation not faithful,
\q1 From a man of deceit\f + Ps 24:4.\f* and perversity save me!
\q1
\v 2 For you are the God of my refuge,
\q1 Why do you reject me?
\q1 Why do I walk about mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
\q1
\v 3 Send your light and your truth,
\q1 Let them lead me,
\q1 Let them bring me to your holy mountain,
\q1 And to your dwelling place.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 4 And I will go to the altar of God, to God the joy of my rejoicing,
\q1 And I will praise you with the lyre, God, my God.
\q1
\v 5 Why are you melting away, O my soul, and unsteady in me,
\q1 Wait for God, for I will again praise him for the helping deeds of his face, my God.
