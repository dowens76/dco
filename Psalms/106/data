\c 106
\p
\v 1 Praise the Lord!
\q1 Give thanks to the Lord for he is good,
\q1 His steadfast love is forever.
\q1
\v 2 Who will speak of the power of the Lord,
\q1 He will make all of his praise heard.
\q1
\v 3 Blessed is the one who keeps justice,
\q1 Who does righteousness at all times.
\q1
\v 4 Remember me, O Lord, in your acceptance of your people,
\q1 Visit me with your salvation.
\q1
\v 5 To see the prosperity of your chosen ones,
\q1 To rejoice in the joy of your people,
\q1 To praise with your inheritance.
\q1
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers,
\q1 We have committed iniquity, we have been evil.
\q1
\v 7 Our fathers in Egypt did not have insight into your wonders,
\q1 They did not remember the multitude of your steadfast love,
\q1 And they rebelled at the sea, at the sea of reeds.
\q1
\v 8 But he saved them for the sake of his name,
\q1 To make known his power.
\q1
\v 9 And he rebuked the sea of reeds and it dried up,
\q1 And he brought them in the deeps, as in the wilderness.
\p
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of the one who hated them,
\q1 And he redeemed them from the hand of an enemy.
\p
\v 11 And the waters covered their enemies,
\q1 Not one from them was left.
\p
\v 12 And they believed in his words,
\q1 And they sang his praise.
\p
\v 13 And they quickly forgot his deeds,
\q1 They did not wait for his plan.
\p
\v 14 And they craved in the wilderness,
\q1 And they tested God at Jeshimon.
\p
\v 15 And he gave to them their request,
\q1 And he sent a disease among them.
\p
\v 16 And they were envious of Moses in the camp,
\q1 Of Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
\q1 And covered over the community of Abiram.
\p
\v 18 And a fire burned in their community,
\q1 A blaze devouring the wicked.
\p
\v 19 They made a calf at Horeb,
\q1 And they worshipped a molten idol.
\q1
\v 20 And they exchanged their glory,
\q1 With an image of a bull which eats grass.
\q1
\v 21 They forgot God their Savior,
\q1 The one who did mighty things in Egypt.
\q1
\v 22 The wonders in the land of Ham,
\q1 Fearsome things by the sea of reeds.
\q1
\v 23 And he said he would destroy them,
\q1 If it weren’t for Moses his chosen one standing in the breech before him,
\q1 To turn away his anger from destruction.
\q1
\v 24 And they despised the land of desire,
\q1 They did not believe in his word.
\q1
\v 25 And they grumbled in their tents,
\q1 They did not listen to the voice of the Lord.
\q1
\v 26 He lifted his hand to them,
\q1 To cause them to fall in the wilderness,
\q1
\v 27 And to cause their seed to fall among the nations,
\q1 And to scatter them among the lands.
\q1
\v 28 And they joined with Baal-peor,
\q1 And they ate sacrifices to the dead.
\q1
\v 29 And they provoked to anger with their deeds,
\q1 And a plague broke out among them.
\q1
\v 30 And Phinehas stood and prayed,
\q1 And the plague held back.
\q1
\v 31 And it was reckoned to him as righteousness,
\q1 For generation to generation forever.
\q1
\v 32 And they provoked to anger at the waters of Meribah,
\q1 And it was bad for Moses on account of them.
\q1
\v 33 For they rebelled against his spirit,
\q1 And he trusted in his lips.
\q1
\v 34 They did not destroy the peoples,
\q1 Whom the Lord said to them.
\q1
\v 35 They mingled with the nations,
\q1 And they learned their works.
\q1
\v 36 They served their idols,
\q1 And they became a snare to them.
\q1
\v 37 And they sacrificed their sons,
\q1 And their daughters to demons.
\q1
\v 38 And they shed innocent blood,
\q1 the blood of their sons and their daugthers,
\q1 Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
\q1 And the land was defiled with the blood.
\q1
\v 39 And they became unclean in their deeds,
\q1 And they prostituted themselves in their works.
\q1
\v 40 And the Lord became angry with his people,
\q1 And he detested his inheritance.
\q1
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the nations,
\q1 And their enemies ruled over them.
\q1
\v 42 And their enemies oppressed them,
\q1 And they were humbled under their hand.
\q1
\v 43 Many times he delivered them,
\q1 And they rebelled in their counsel,
\q1 And they wasted away in sin.
\q1
\v 44 And he looked on their distress,
\q1 When he heard their cry.
\q1
\v 45 And he remembered his covenant for them,
\q1 And he relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love.
\q1
\v 46 And he gave them to compassion,
\q1 Before all those who captured them.
\q1
\v 47 Save us, O Lord our God,
\q1 And gather us from the nations,
\q1 To give thanks to your holy name,
\q1 To glory in your renown.
\q1
\v 48 Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
\q1 From eternity to eternity,
\q1 And let all the people say “Amen,”
\q1 Praise the Lord!
