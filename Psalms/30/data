\v 1
\d A psalm, song of dedication of the house, of David
\q1
\v 2 I will exalt you, O YHWH, for you drew me up,
\q1 And you have not allowed my enemies to rejoice over me.
\q1
\v 3 YHWH my God I cried for help to you,
\q1 And you healed me.
\q1
\v 4 O YHWH, you brought my life up from Sheol,
\q1 You preserved me from those going down to the pit.
\q1
\v 5 Sing to YHWH, you faithful ones,
\q1 And praise to the mention of his holiness.
\q1
\v 6 For a moment in his anger, life in his favor,
\q1 In the evening weeping remains,
\q1 But in the morning a shout of joy.
\q1
\v 7 And I have said in my ease,
\q1 "I will not totter forever."\f + Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1
\v 8 YHWH in your favor you made [me] stand as a strong mountain;
\q1 You hid your face, I was terrified.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 9 To you, O YHWH I cried,
\q1 And to my Lord I plead for grace.
\q1
\v 10 What profit is there in my blood,
\q1 When I go down to the pit?
\q1 Will the dust praise you?
\q1 Will it tell of your reliability?
\q1
\v 11 Hear O YHWH and be graceious to me,
\q1 O YHWH, be my helper!
\q1
\v 12 You have overturned my mourning to dancing,
\q1 For me you have taken off my sackcloth.
\q1 And you have clothed me with joy.
\q1
\v 13 So that glory\f + NRSV and NET emend, "my soul."\f* will praise you and not be still,
\q1 O YHWH my God, I will praise you forever.
