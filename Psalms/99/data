\v 1 The Lord reigns, let the peoples tremble,
\q1 He sits on the cherubim, let the earth quake.
\q1
\v 2 The Lord is great in Zion,
\q1 And he is exalted over all the peoples.
\q1
\v 3 Let them praise your great and awesome name,
\q1 Holy is he!
\q1
\v 4 And in his might the King loves justice,
\q1 You have established uprightness,
\q1 Justice and righteousness you have done in Jacob.
\q1
\v 5 Exalt the Lord our God,
\q1 And worship at his footstool.
\q1 Holy is he!

\v 6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests,
\q1 And Samuel was among those who call on his name.
\q1 They called to the Lord and he answered them.
\q1
\v 7 In the pillar of clouds he spoke to them,
\q1 They kept his testimonies,
\q1 And the statute he gave to them.
\q1
\v 8 O Lord our God you answered them,
\q1 You were a God who pardoned for them,
\q1 But you took revenge on their deeds.
\q1
\v 9 Exalt the Lord our God,
\q1 And worship at his holy mountain
\q1 For the Lord our God is holy.
