\c 92
\p
\v 1 A Psalm, a song for the sabbath day.
\q1
\v 2 It is good to give thanks to the Lord
\q1 And to sing praise to your name, O Most High.
\q1
\v 3 To tell of your steadfast love in the morning
\q1 And your faithfulness at night.
\q1
\v 4 On a ten-stringed instrument and on a harp
\q1 To the playing of the lyre.
\q1
\v 5 For have made me glad, O Lord, by your work
\q1 At the work of your hands I shout with joy.
\q1
\v 6 How great are your works, O Lord,
\q1 How exdeedingly deep are your thoughts.
\q1
\v 7 A stupid man does not know
\q1 And the foolish does not understand this,
\q1
\v 8 With a bud the wicked are like grass
\q1 And all evil-doers sprout
\q1 To be exterminated forever.
\q1
\v 9 But you are on high forever, O Lord.
\p
\v 10 For behold your enemies, O Lord,
\q1 For behold your enemies will perish
\q1 All evil-doers will be scattered.
\p
\v 11 And you have exalted my horn like a wild ox
\q1 I have poured\f + \ft ?\f* with luxurious oil.
\p
\v 12 And my eyes have seen with my sight\f + \ft ?\f* those who rise against me
\q1 My ears have heard their injury\f + \ft ?\f* .
\p
\v 13 The righteous bud like the date plam
\q1 Like a cedar in Lebanon it grows great.
\p
\v 14 Planted in the house of the Lord,
\q1 In the courtyard of our God they bud.
\p
\v 15 Still they prosper in old age,
\q1 They are fat and full of leaves.
\p
\v 16 To declare that the Lord is upright,
\q1 My rock, and there is no wickedness in him.
