\c 104
\p
\v 1 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
\q1 O Lord my God you are exceedingly great!
\q1 You are clothed in splendor and majesty.
\q1
\v 2 He is clothed with light as a cloak,\f + \ft person of the participles?\f*
\q1 He stretched out the heavens like a tent.
\q1
\v 3 He has laid the beams of your upper room on the waters,
\q1 He has placed the clouds as his chariot,
\q1 He goes on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 4 He has made the wind his messengers,
\q1 Fire and flame are his ministers.
\q1
\v 5 He laid the foundations of the earth on its foundation,
\q1 It will never slip.
\q1
\v 6 He covered it with the deep as a garment,
\q1 On the mountains the waters stood.
\q1
\v 7 At your rebuke they fled,
\q1 From the sound of your thunder they hurried away.
\q1
\v 8 The mountains rose, the valleys went down,
\q1 To this place you laid a foundation for them.
\q1
\v 9 You set a boundary that they might not pass by,
\q1 So that they might not return to cover the earth.
\p
\v 10 He sent out springs in the river valleys,
\q1 Between the mountains they come.
\p
\v 11 They give drink to all the beasts of the field,
\q1 Wild donkeys break\f + \ft ?\f* their thirst.
\p
\v 12 By them the birds of the air dwell,
\q1 From between the branches they give their song.
\p
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his upper room,
\q1 From the fruit of your works you satisfy the earth.
\p
\v 14 Green grass sprouts up for cattle,
\q1 And herbs for man to work,
\q1 To bring out food from the earth.
\p
\v 15 And wine gladdens the heart of man,
\q1 To make faces shine from oil,
\q1 And food refreshes the heart of man.
\p
\v 16 The trees of the Lord are satisified,
\q1 The cedars of Lebanon which he planted.
\p
\v 17 In which birds make a nest,
\q1 Water birds have their home in the pine tree.
\p
\v 18 High mountains are for the mountain goats,
\q1 The rocks are a refuge for the rock-badger.
\p
\v 19 He made the moon for its seasons,
\q1 The sun knows its setting.
\q1
\v 20 You set darkness and it is night,
\q1 In it all the beasts of the forest creep.
\q1
\v 21 The strong lions roar for prey,
\q1 To seek their food from God.
\q1
\v 22 The sun rises, they gather\f + \ft ?\f* ,
\q1 And in their dens they lie down.
\q1
\v 23 Man goes out to his work,
\q1 And to his labor until evening.
\q1
\v 24 How many are your works, O Lord,
\q1 All of them you made with wisdom,
\q1 The earth is filled with your possessions.
\q1
\v 25 This is the sea, great and wide,
\q1 Hands there creatures\f + \ft ?\f*
\q1 And there is no number
\q1 Beasts, small with great.
\q1
\v 26 There go boats,
\q1 Leviathan which you formed to play in it.
\q1
\v 27 All of them look to you
\q1 To give their food in season.
\q1
\v 28 You give to them, they gather,
\q1 You open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
\q1
\v 29 You hide your face, they are dismayed,
\q1 You remove their breath, they die
\q1 And to their dust they return.
\q1
\v 30 You send your spirit, they are created,
\q1 You renew the face of the ground.
\q1
\v 31 May the glory of the Lord be forever,
\q1 Let the Lord rejoice in his works.
\q1
\v 32 He looks at the earth and it trembles,
\q1 He touches the mountains and they smoke.
\q1
\v 33 I will sing to the Lord while I live,
\q1 I will sing praise fo my God while I still live
\q1
\v 34 May my meditation be pleasing to him,
\q1 I will rejoice in the Lord.
\q1
\v 35 May sinners be finished from the earth,
\q1 And let the wicked be no more,
\q1 Bless the Lord, O my soul,
\q1 Praise the Lord.
