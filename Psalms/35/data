\c 35
\p
\v 1 Of David
\q1 Contend, O Lord, with my adversary
\q1 Fight with those who fight with me
\q1
\v 2 Take hold of a buckler and a shield
\q1 And arise for my help
\q1
\v 3 Draw out a spear
\q1 Close in against those who pursue me
\q1 Say to my soul, “I am your salvation.”\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1
\v 4 Let them be ashamed
\q1 And let them be humiliated, who seek my soul
\q1 Let them be driven backwards
\q1 And let them be ashamed, who plan my injury\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 5 Let them be as chaff before the wind
\q1 And an angel of the Lord pushing\f + them\f*
\q1
\v 6 Let their way be darkness and slipperiness
\q1 While the angel of the Lord is pursuing them
\q1
\v 7 For without cause they hid for me a pit net
\q1 Without cause they dug a snare for my soul\f + Ps 15:3.\f*
\q1
\v 8 Let devastation come upon him while he does not know
\q1 And Let his net which he has hid catch him:
\q1 with destruction let him fall in it
\q1
\v 9 And my soul will rejoice in the Lord
\q1 It shall rejoice in his salvation
\p
\v 10 All of my bones will say, “O Lord, who is like you,
\q1 Who delivers the poor man from those stronger than himself
\q1 And the poor and the needy from he who robs him?
\p
\v 11 Witnesses of violence rise up
\q1 That which I do not know they ask of me
\p
\v 12 They reward me evil in exchange for good
\q1 To the bereavement of my soul
\p
\v 13 But I, when they were weak, my clothing was sackcloth
\q1 I weakened myself with fasting
\q1 And my prayer returned upon my bosom
\p
\v 14 As if it were my friend or brother I walked about
\q1 As a mourner of a mother bowed down mourning
\p
\v 15 But at my stumbling they rejoiced and gathered themselves together\f + Cf. Ps 15:5.\f*
\q1 Attackers gathered together against me and I did not know
\q1 They tore and were not silent
\p
\v 16 Like godless buffoons
\q1 They gnashed at me with their teeth
\p
\v 17 O Lord, how long will you watch?
\q1 Rescue my life from their ravages
\q1 My only life from the lions
\p
\v 18 I will give thanks to you in the great congregation
\q1 Among the numerous people I will praise you.
\p
\v 19 Do not let those who are wrongfully enemies rejoice over me
\q1 Nor let those who hate me\f + Ps 15:3.\f* without cause wink the eye maliciously
\q1
\v 20 For they do not speak peace
\q1 But against those who are quiet in the land words of treachery they invent
\q1
\v 21 They opened their mouth wide against me
\q1 They said, “Aha, aha our eyes have seen it!”
\q1
\v 22 You have seen it, O Lord, do not be silent
\q1 O Lord, do not be far from me
\q1
\v 23 Rouse yourself and awake to my right
\q1 To my cause, my God and my Lord.
\q1
\v 24 Judge me according to righteousness, O Lord my God,
\q1 And do not let them rejoice over me
\q1
\v 25 Do not let them say in their heart, “Aha, our desire!”
\q1 Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”
\q1
\v 26 Let them be ashamed and put to shame all together who rejoice at my injury
\q1 Let them be clothed with shame and insult, those who magnify themselves over me
\q1
\v 27 Let those who delight in my vindication shout for joy and rejoice
\q1 And let them say continually, “The Lord is great, who delights in the peace of his servant
\q1
\v 28 And my tongue will utter your righteousness
\q1 All the day your praise
