\q1
\v 2 O YHWH, the king rejoices in your strength,
\q1 And in your salvation\f + Ps 24:5.\f* he shouts in exceeding joy.
\q1
\v 3 The longing of his heart you grant him,
\q1 And the desire of his lips you do not deny.\qs Selah\qs*
\q1
\v 4 For you place before him good blessings,
\q1 You set on his head a crown of pure gold.
\q1
\v 5 Life he asked of you that you give to him,
\q1 Length of days forever and ever.
\q1
\v 6 Great is his honor in your salvation,\f + Ps 24:5.\f*
\q1 Majesty and splendor you place on him.
\q1
\v 7 For you put on him blessings for ever,
\q1 You make him glad by the joy with your face.\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1
\v 8 For the king trusts in YHWH,
\q1 And by the steadfast love of the Most High he does not stumble.
\q1
\v 9 Your hand reaches to all your enemies,
\q1 Your right hand reaches to those who hate you.\f + Cf. Ps 15:4.\f*
\q1
\v 10 You set them like a fiery furnace at the time of your appearing,\f + Ps 15:1; 24:3.\f*
\q1 YHWH in his anger swallows them up,
\q1 And you consume them with fire.\f + Cf. Isa 33:14.\f*
\q1
\v 11 Their fruit from the earth you destroy,
\q1 And their seed from the sons of man.
\q1
\v 12 When they extended harm against you,
\q1 They devised a plot,
\q1 They will not prevail.
\q1
\v 13 For you will make them a shoulder,\f + NRSV/ESV: to flight; NET note suggests the shoulder indicates flight.\f*
\q1 With your bow-string you will fix at their faces.
\q1
\v 14 Rise up, O YHWH, in your strength,
\q1 We will sing and praise your strength.
