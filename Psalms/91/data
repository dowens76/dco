\c 91
\p
\v 1 He who dwells in the refuge of the Most High
\q1 Will live in the shadow of the Almighty.
\q1
\v 2 I will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my stronghold,
\q1 My God, I trust in him.”
\q1
\v 3 For he will deliver you from the trap of the bird-catcher
\q1 From the plague of destruction.
\q1
\v 4 With his wings he will cover you,
\q1 And under his wings you will seek refuge,
\q1 A shield and a wall is his faithfulness.
\q1
\v 5 You will not fear the terror of night
\q1 Or the arrow that flies by day.
\q1
\v 6 Or the plague that walks in darkness,
\q1 Or the sting that devastates at midday.
\q1
\v 7 A thousand will fall at your side
\q1 And ten thousand at your right hand,
\q1 But it will not come near you.
\q1
\v 8 Only with your eyes you will look
\q1 And the retribution of the wicked you will see.
\q1
\v 9 For you, the Lord my refuge,
\q1 You have made the Most High your help.
\p
\v 10 Evil shall not happen on you
\q1 And a plague will not come near to your tent.
\p
\v 11 For his angels he will command concerning you,
\q1 To keep you in all your ways.
\p
\v 12 On their hands they will lift you up
\q1 Lest your foot stumble against a stone.
\p
\v 13 On the lion cub and the cobra you will tread,
\q1 You will trample on the young lion and the serpent.
\p
\v 14 “Because he clings to me, I will bring him to safety,
\q1 I will protect him for he knows my name.
\p
\v 15 He will call to me and I will answer him,
\q1 I will be with him in distress,
\q1 I will save him and honor him.
\p
\v 16 With length of days I will satsify him
\q1 And I wil show him my salvation.”
