\v 1 Although\f ++There is no conjunction at the beginning of v. 2. This concessive conjunction is included in order to represent the logic of the passage.\f* formerly God spoke \f ++A, A, Part., M, S, N.\f* to (our) forefathers many times and in many ways through the prophets,
\v 2 in these last days he spoke \f ++A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* to us through (his) son, whom he placed \f ++A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* as heir of all things, through whom also he made \f ++A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* the universe,
\v 3 who, being \f ++Pr., Part., M, S, N.\f* the radiance of his glory and the representation of his being (or nature), sustaining \f ++Pr., A, Part., M, S, N.\f* all things by the word of his power, after he performed \f ++A, M, Part., M, S, N.\f* the cleansing of sins, he sat down \f ++A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens,
\v 4 being \f ++A, M, Part., M, S, N.\f* as much greater than the angels as he has inherited a name which is superior to them.\f ++Question: Why does the author compare the Son to angels?\f*

\v 5 For to which of the angels did he ever say,
\q1 "You are my son,
\q2 Today I have begotten you."
\p and again,
\q1 "I will be a father to him,
\q2 And he will be my son"?
