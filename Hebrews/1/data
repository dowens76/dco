\v 1 Although\f + There is no conjunction at the beginning of v. 2. This concessive conjunction is included in order to represent the logic of the passage.\f* formerly God spoke \f + A, A, Part., M, S, N.\f* to (our) forefathers many times and in many ways through the prophets,
\v 2 in these last days he spoke \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* to us through (his) son, whom he placed \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* as heir of all things, through whom also he made \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* the universe,
\v 3 who, being \f + Pr., Part., M, S, N.\f* the radiance of his glory and the representation of his being (or nature), sustaining \f + Pr., A, Part., M, S, N.\f* all things by the word of his power, after he performed \f + A, M, Part., M, S, N.\f* the cleansing of sins, he sat down \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S.\f* at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens,
\v 4 being \f + A, M, Part., M, S, N.\f* as much greater than the angels as he has inherited a name which is superior to them.\f + Question: Why does the author compare the Son to angels?\f*
\p
\v 5 For to which of the angels did he ever say,\qt "You are my son, today I have begotten you,"\qt*\x + Ps 2:7.\x* and again,\qt "I will be a father to him, and he will be my son"\qt*?\x + 2 Sam 7:14.\x*
\v 6 But when again he brings the firstborn into the world he says, \qt "And let all of God's angels worship him."\x + Deut 32:14 (LXX).\x*\qt*
\v 7 And to the angels he says,\qt "The one who made the angels as spirits and his servants a flaming fire,"\qt*,
\v 8 But to the son, \qt "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the rod of your kingdom is a rod of uprightness.\qt*
\v 9 You loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; because of this God, your God, anointed you with the oil of exultation more than your companions."
\v 10 And, \qt "You, in the beginning, O Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands;\qt*
\v 11 they will perish, but you remain, and all things will get old like a garment,
\v 12 and as a cloak you will roll them up," as a garment \qt "also they will change; but you are the same and your years will not give out."\qt*
\v 13 But to which of the angels has he ever said, \qt "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool"\qt*?
\v 14 Are they all not ministering spirits sent for service on behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation?
