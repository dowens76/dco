\v 23 By faith Moses, when we was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful and they did not fear the order of the king.
\v 24 By faith Moses, when he was grown, renounced being called son of the daughter of Pharaoh,
\v 25 preferring to suffer with the people of God more than to have the temporary pleasures of sin,
\v 26 because he considered considering the riches of the reproach of Christ greater than the treasures of Egypt. For he kept his eyes on the reward.
