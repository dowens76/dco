\v 1 Because of this it is necessary for us to pay attention to what we heard, lest we drift away.
\v 2 For if the word spoken through angels was reliable, and every transgression and disobedience received just punishment,
\v 3 how will we escape, if we have neglected so great a salvation, which at the beginning took to be spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed by those in us who heard,
\v 4 while God testified at the same time with signs and wonders and diverse miracles and the Holy Spirit by distributions according to his will?
\p
\v 5 For it was not to angels that he subjected the world to come, about which we speak.
\v 6 But it was testified somewhere, saying, \qt "What is man that you remember him, or the son of man that you look at him?\qt*\qt  \qt* \qt 7\qt* \qt  You made him a little lower than angels, and you crowned him with glory and honor, \qt* \qt 8\qt* \qt  and you subjected all things under his feet."\qt* For while subjecting all things to him he did not let anything be independent of him.
\v 9 But we see Jesus, the one who was briefly made lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor through the suffering of death, in order that through the grace of God he might taste death for all.
\p
\v 10 For it was fitting for him, because of whom and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to complete the founder of their salvation through suffering.
\v 11 For the one who sanctifies and those sanctified are all from one; because of that reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
\v 12 saying, \qt "I will tell of your name among my brothers, in the midst of the assembly I will sing your praise,"\qt*
\v 13 And again, \qt "I will trust in him,"\qt* and again, \qt "Behold I and the children that God gave to me."\qt*
\v 14 Therefore since the children share blood and flesh, he himself likewise participated in the same things in order that through death he might bring to an end the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
\v 15 and free these, as many as in fear of death through all of life were subjected to slavery.
\v 16 For surely it is not angels he is concerned about but the seed of Abraham.
\v 17 For that reason he had to become like his brothers in all respects in order that he might be a compassionate and faithful high priest to God to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
\v 18 For in what he suffered while being tempted, he is able to help those being tempted.
