\v 1 Because of this it is necessary for us to pay attention to what we heard, lest we drift away.
\v 2 For if the word spoken through angels was reliable, and every transgression and disobedience received just punishment,
\v 3 how will we escape, if we have neglected so great a salvation, which at the beginning took to be spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed by those in us who heard,
\v 4 while God testified at the same time with signs and wonders and diverse miracles and the Holy Spirit by distributions according to his will?
\p
\v 5 For it was not to angels that he subjected the world to come, about which we speak.
\v 6 But it was testified somewhere, saying, \qt "What is man that you remember him, or the son of man that you look at him?\qt*\qt  \qt* \qt 7\qt* \qt  You made him a little lower than angels, and you crowned him with glory and honor, \qt* \qt 8\qt* \qt  and you subjected all things under his feet."\qt* For while subjecting all things to him he did not let anything be independent of him.
