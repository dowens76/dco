\v 1 Because of this it is necessary for us to pay attention to what we heard, lest we drift away.
\v 2 For if the word spoken through angels was reliable, and every transgression and disobedience received just punishment,
\v 3 how will we escape, if we have neglected so great a salvation, which at the beginning took to be spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed by those in us who heard,
\v 4 while God testified at the same time with signs and wonders and diverse miracles and the Holy Spirit by distributions according to his will?
