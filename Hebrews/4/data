\v 1 Therefore let us fear, lest while the promise remains any of you may fail to enter his rest.
\v 2 For also we received good news as did those ones; but the word they heard did not benefit those ones because they were not united in faith with those who heard.
\v 3 For we who believe enter that rest, just as he said, \qt "As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest,"\qt* yet the works existed from the foundation of the world.
\v 4 For he has spoken somewhere concerning the seventh day thus: \qt "And God rested from all his works on the seventh day,"\qt*
\v 5 And in this again, \qt "\qt*\qt They shall not enter my rest."\qt*
\v 6 Therefore since it remains for some to enter it, also those formerly to whom the good news was preached did not enter because of disobedience,
\v 7 again he fixed a certain day, "Today," through David saying after so long a time, just as he said before, \qt "Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts." \qt*
\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken concerning another after these days.
\v 9 Therefore there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God.
\v 10 For the one who enters his rest also ceases from his works just as God did from his own.
\v 11 Therefore let us make every effort to enter into that rest, in order that no one might fail by the same kind of disobedience.
\v 12 For The word of God is living and powerful and is sharper than any double-edged sword and pierces as far as the division of soul and spirit, of joints and of marrow, and judges the thoughts and insights of the heart.
\v 13 And no creature is hidden before him, but all are naked and laid bare to his eyes, to whom we must give account.\f + So ESV. This phrase, "πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος," is difficult. Translated literally, it means "to whom the word is for us." Attridge (p. 136) comments, "It resembles formulaic conclusions found, for example, in Philo, meaning 'our account is about him (or it),' but the phrase certainly suggests more than that: God who sees and judges is the one 'to whom our account must finally be rendered.'"\f*

\v 14 Therefore, because we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold on to the confession.
\v 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but he was similarly tempted in every way, yet without sin.
\v 16 Therefore let us approach the throne of grace with confidence, in order that we might receive mercy and grace, that we may find help at the right time.\f +++\f*
