\v 1 Therefore let us fear, lest while the promise remains any of you may fail to enter his rest.
\v 2 For also we received  good news as did those ones; but the word they heard did not benefit those ones because they were not united in faith with those who heard.
\v 3 For we who believe enter that rest, just as he said, "As I swore in my wrath,  they shall not enter my rest," yet the works existed from the foundation of the world.
