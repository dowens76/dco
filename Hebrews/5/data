\v 5 So also Christ did not glorify himself to become high priest but the one who said to him, \qt "You are my son, today I have begotten you."\qt*
\v 6 As he says in another place, \qt "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."\qt*
\v 7 He, in the days of his flesh, brought prayers and supplications to the one who is able to save him from death with a loud cry and tears and was heard because of his reverence,
\v 8 though he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered,
\v 9 and being perfected, he became source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
\v 10 being designated by God as high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
