\v 1 Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus
\p  through the will of God\f + Paul's calling is a matter of divine choice. He fulfills his calling as a matter of obedience and his new identity in God.\f*
\p and Timothy\f + F. F. Bruce citing C. F. Wake in Paul: Apostle of the Heart Set Free p. 408 thinks that the inclusion of Timothy in the greeting may mean that Timothy was Paul's amanuensis for this letter.\f* the brother,
\q1
\v 2 to the saints and faithful brothers in Christ\f + Paul addresses his audience as Christians.\f* who are in Colossae.
\p Grace to you and peace from God our Father.\f + Paul offers a blessing on the basis of their shared identity as children of God.\f*
\p
\v 3 We always give thanks\f + Paul gives thanks TO GOD because of the Colossians' FAITH and LOVE. He implies that these are from God.\f* to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ while praying for you,
\v 4 because we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love which you have for all the saints
\v 5 because of the hope\f + \fr 1.5: \fr Hope is the basis for the Colossians' love faith and love, or perhaps just for the love, which is the most immediate antecedant.\f* which is stored away for you in heaven, which you heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel
\v 6 which came to you, just as also it is bearing fruit in all the world and growing just as also in you, from the day which you heard and you understood the grace of God in truth;
\v 7 just as you learned from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf,
\v 8 who informed us of your love in Spirit.
\p
\v 9 Because of this even we, from the day which we heard, have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,\f + \fr 1.9: \fr Paul prays for God to fill their minds in order to transform their lives. The walk with God begins on the inside.\f*
\v 10 to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord in every pleasing thing so that you bear fruit in every good work and grow in the knowledge of God,\f + \fr 1.10: \fr Knowledge abounds to behavior that abounds to more knowledge. Discipleship is a cycle of knowledge and behavior that results in a person committed to God in every way.\f*
\v 11 with all power being enabled according to the might of his glory for all perseverance and forbearance.\f + \fr 1.11: \fr The end result of the cycle of transformative knowledge and behavior is perseverance by the power of God.\f* With joy
\v 12 we give thanks to the Father who makes us sufficient for the portion of the heritage of the saints in the light,\f + \fr 1.12: \fr The light stands for the kingdom of light, as opposed to the kingdom of darkness, from which vv. 13â€“14 declare we have been delievered (NBC).\f*
\v 13 who delivered us from the authority of darkness and transfered us to the kingdom of his beloved son,\f + \fr 1.13: \fr The transferance from one kingdom to the other is the transformation of enemies into friends. Compare Psalm 2, where the kings of the earth are rebels. In Christ they can be transferred to God's kingdom.\f*
\v 14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
\p
\v 15 He is the image of the invisible God, firstborn of all creation,\f + \fr 1.15: \fr This section is all about God's relationship to the creation through Christ. In this Christ is preeminent.\f*
\v 16 because in him all things were created in the heavens and on the earth, what is seen and what is unseen whether thrones or powers whether rulers or authorities all things were created by him and for him;
\v 17 and he is before all things and all things hold together in him
\v 18 and he is the head of the body of the Church; He is the beginning the firstborn of the dead ones in order that he might be above all else in all things
\v 19 because in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell
\v 20 and through him to reconcile all things to himself, to make peace through the blood of his cross, through him whether things on the earth or things in the heavens.
\v 21 and once while you were strangers and enemies to the mind in all the evil works,
\v 22 but now he reconciled you in the body of his flesh through his death to present you holy and blameless and without fault before him,
\v 23 if indeed you remain in faith having been established firmly and steadfast and not moving from the hope of the Gospel which you heard, which was preached in all creation under the heavens, of which I, Paul, became a servant.
\p
\v 24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up what was lacking in the sufferings of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the church,
\v 25 of which I became a servant according to the plan of God which was given to me to fulfill the word of God for you,
\v 26 the mystery which was concealed from the ages and from the generations but now is revealed to his saints,
\v 27 to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, who is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
\v 28 whom we proclaim, admonishing every person and teaching every person with all wisdom, in order that we may present every person complete in Christ.
\v 29 For this also I labor, struggling according to his working which he works in me with power.\f ++Paul's struggles are God's plan, but he rejoices in his suffering on their behalf because of the great work of God of which he is part. May I never shrink from suffering that comes because of my calling and for the sake of his people.\f*
