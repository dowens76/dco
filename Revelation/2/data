\v 12And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: "This the one who has the sharp double-edged sword says,
\v 13'I know where you live, where is the throne of Satan, and you hold fast to my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
\v 14But I have a little against you, that you have held fast to the teaching of Balaam, who taught to Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat food sacrificed to idols and to fornicate.
\v 15Thus you have also those holding fast to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
\v 16 Therefore repent; but if not, I am coming to you quickly and I will wage war with them with the sword of my mouth.
\v 17 The one who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches. To the one who overcomes I will give to him the hidden manna, and I will give to him a white pebble, and a new name will be written on the pebble that no one knows except the one who receives it.
