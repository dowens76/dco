\c 21
\p
\v 1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and fifty five years he ruled in Jerusalem and his mother’s name was Hephzibah\f + \ft my delight is in her\f* .
\v 2 Ad he did evil in the eyes of the Lord according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord dispossessed from before the Israelites.
\v 3 And turned back and rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed\f + \ft Piel, Perf.\f* and he set up altars for Baal and he made an Asherah as Ahab king of Israel had dome and he worshipped all the host of heaven and he served them.
\v 4 And he built altars in the house of the Lord which the Lord had said, “In Jerusalem I will place my name.”
\v 5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord.
\v 6 And he made his son pass through fire and practiced soothsaying and divination and practiced necromancy and spirits he multiplied to do much evil in the eyes of the Lord to provoke him.
\v 7 And he set the idol of Asherah which he made in the house which the Lord had said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel I will place my name forever.
\v 8 And I will not again cause the feet of Israel to wander\f + \ft Hiph., Inf.\f* from the ground which I have given to their fathers, only if they keep doing according to all which I commanded them and for all the law which my servant Moses commanded them.”
\v 9 But they did not listen and Manasseh caused them to wander\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., hut\f* to do the evil more than the nations which the Lord had destroyed from before the Israelites.
\v 10 And the Lord spoke by the hand of his servants the prophets saying,
\v 11 “Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, having done evil above all what the Amorites who were before him had doen, and he made Judah also sin with idols,
\v 12 therefore thus says the Lord the God of Israel, ‘Behold I am bringing calamity on Jerusalem and Judah which everyone who hears it, his two ears will tingle\f + \ft llx\f* .
\v 13 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plumbline of the house of Ahab, and I wil wipe out\f + \ft hjm\f* Jerusalem as one wipes the dish, wiping and turning on its face.
\v 14 And I will leave\f + \ft vfn\f* the remnant of my inheritance and give them into the hand of their enemies and they will become spoil and plunder for all their enemies.
\v 15 Because they have done evil in my eyes and have been provoking me to anger from the day when their fathers went out of Egypt until this day.’”
\v 16 And also Manasseh poured out much innocent blood until when he filled Jerusalem from end to end, apart from his sin which he made Judah sin to do evil in the eyes of the Lord.
\v 17 And the rest of the matters of Manasseh and all which he did and his sin which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the matters of days of the kings of Judah?
\v 18 And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his house in the garden of Uzza, and Amon his son became king in his place.
\v 19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king and he reigned two years in Jerusalem and the name of his mother was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah.
\v 20 And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord as Manasseh his father had done.
\v 21 And he walked in every which which his father had walked and he served the idols which his father served and he worshipped them.
\v 22 And he abandoned the Lord the God of his fathers and he did not go in the way of the Lord.
\v 23 And the servants of Amon conspired against him and they killed the king in his house.
\v 24 And the people of the land struck all those who conspired against King Amon and the people of the land made Josiah his son king instead of him.
\v 25 And the rest of the matters of Amon, what he did, are they not written in the book of the matters of the days of the kings of Judah?
\v 26 And\f + \ft they\f* buried him in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah his son ruled in his place.
