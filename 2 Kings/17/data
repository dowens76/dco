\v 1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz, King of Judah, Hoshea, son of Elah, became king in Samaria over Israel for nine years.
\v 2 And he did evil in the eyes of the Lord, only not as the kings of Israel who were before him.
\v 3 Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against him and Hoshea became his servant and he returned tribute to him.
\v 4 And the king of Assyria found a conspiracy in Hoshea who had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt and had not brought up tribute to the king of Assyria as year by year\f + \ft he had done\f* , so the king of Assyria detained him and bound him up in prison\f + \ft house of imprisonment\f* .
\v 5 The King of Assyria went up in all the land and he went up to Samaria and he besieged it for three years.
\v 6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria and he deported Israel to Assyria, and he made them dwell\f + \ft Hiph.\f* in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and the cities of the Medes.
\v 7 And it happened because the Israelites sinned against the Lord their God who brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and they had feared other gods
\v 8 and they walked in the statutes of the nations whom the Lord dispossessed\f + \ft Hiph., Perf.\f* from before the Israelites and the kings of Israel which they had done\f + \ft ?\f* .
\v 9 And the Israelites did things secretly\f + \ft Piel, Impf.\f* which were not right according to the Lord their God and they built for themselves high places in all their cities from watch tower to fortified city.
\v 10 And they erected for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every fresh\f + \ft green\f* tree.
\v 11 and they burned incense there on all the high places as the nations which the Lord had taken into exile from before them and they did evil things to provoke\f + \ft Hiph., Inf.\f* the Lord.
\v 12 And they served idols which the Lord had said to them “You shall not do this thing.”
\v 13 And the Lord warned\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., dwu\f* Israel and Judah by the hand of all his prophets, every seer saying, “Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments, my statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers and which I sent to you by the hand of my servants the prophets.”
\v 14 But they did not listen and they stiffened\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., hvq\f* their neck like the neck of their fathers who did not trust\f + \ft Hiph., Perf.\f* in the Lord their God.
\v 15 And they rejected his statutes and his covenant which he had made with their fathers and his testimony with which he warned them and they went after vanity and became vain and after the nations which surrounded them which the Lord had commanded them not to do like them.
\v 16 And they abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God and they made for themselves molten images, two calves, and they made an Asherah and they worshipped all the host of heaven and they served Baal.
\v 17 And they brought their sons and their daughters through fire and they practiced magic and practiced divination and they sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the Lord to provoke him to anger.
\v 18 And the Lord was exceedingly angry with Israel and removed them\f + \ft Hiph., Impf.\f* from before his face; no one was left except the tribe of Judah alone.
\v 19 Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God and they walked in the statutes of Israel which they had done.
\v 20 And the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel and afflicted them\f + \ft Piel, Impf.\f* and gave them into the hand of plunderers until he cast them from before him.
\v 21 When he had torn Israel from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat king and Jeroboam drove Israel away from after the Lord and made them commit a great sin.
\v 22 The Israelites walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he had done; they did not turn aside from them.
\v 23 until the Lord removed Israel from before his face as he had spoken by the hand of his servants the prophets and the took Israel into exile from their land to Assyria unto this day.
\v 24 And the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sephar-vaim and the settled them in the cities of Samaria instead of the Israelites and they took possession of Samaria and they lived in its cities.
\v 25 And in the beginning of their living\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* there they did not fear the Lrod and the Lord sent lions among them and they killed among them.
\v 26 And they said to the king of Assyria saying, “The nations which you brought into exile and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the rule of the god of the land and he has sant among them lions and behold they killed them\f + \ft Hiph., Part.\f* because they don’t know the judgment of the god of the land.”
\v 27 And the king of Assyria commanded saying, “Bring there one of the priests whom you brought into exil from there and let them go and let them live there and let him teach them\f + \ft Hiph., Impf.\f* the judgment of the god of the land.”
\v 28 And one of the priests whom they had brought into exile from Samaria came and lived in Bethel and began to teach them how they should fear the Lord.
\v 29 And nation by nation was making its gods and putting them in the house of the high places which the people of Samaria had made, nation by nation in their cities where they were living.
\v 30 And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth and the men of Cuth made Nergal and the maen of Hamath made Ashima.
\v 31 And the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharvites burned their sons with fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech the gods of Sepharvaim.
\v 32 And they feared the Lord and made for themselves from their ends priests of the high places and they were acting for them in the houses of the high places.
\v 33 They were fearing the Lord and their gods they were serving according to the judgment of the nations from which they brought into exile.
\v 34 Until this day they are doing according to the former judgments; they do not fear the Lord and they do not do according to their statutes or according to their judgments or according to the law or according to the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob whose name he made Israel.
\v 35 And the Lord made a covenant with them and commanded them saying, “You shall not fear other gods and you shall not worship them and you sall not serve them and you shall not slaughter for sacrifice to them.
\v 36 But the Lord who brought you up from the land of Egypt in great strength and an outstretched arm, you shall fear him and worship him and slaugther for sacrifice to him.
\v 37 And the statutes and judgments and law and command which he wrote to you, you shall keep to do all days and you shall not fear other gods.
\v 38 “And the covenant which I made with you you shall not forget and you shall not fear other gods.”
\v 39 But the Lord your God you shall fear and he will deliver you from the hand of your enemies.
\v 40 But they did not listen but according to their former judgments they did.
\v 41 And these nations feared the Lord and they were serving their idols, even their sons and the sons of their sons, as their fathers did they did until this day.
