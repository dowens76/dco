\v 1 And all the people\f + \fr 8.1: \ft NRSV, Fensham, and Kidner link Neh 7:72b[73b] with what follows. The phrase בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל corrresponds to כָל־הָעָם. As for the chronology, various views exist for where this narrative fits. Some think it should come after Ezra 10 as memoris of Ezra. Others think Neh 2-10 come after Exra 8. Some think Ezra 8-10 was inserted by the Chronicler. Finally, some think these follow Neh 13. Fensham suggests the best solution is that "the Chronicler composed these chapters from the memoirs of Ezra" (Fensham 215).\f* gathered as one man\f + \fr 8.1: \ft Kidner notes that this chaper displays "a mood of rare responsiveness" among the people, who were not formally called by the leaders but came spontaneously (Kidner, 113).\f* to the square which was in front of the Water Gate\f + \fr 8.1: \ft This did not take place at the temple since men and women are included (Fensham, 216). That this happened at a center of city life where it most needed to be heard, not at the temple; cf. Deut 6:7ff. (Kidner, 114).\f* and they said to Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Torah of Moses,\f + \fr 8.1: \ft Fensham suggests this is "quite probably part of the Pentateuch," though, judging by the time involved in reading it, could not have been the whole Pentateuch (216). Kidner emphasizes that Ezra did not create a "new manifesto" but rather read from the "foundation articles of the faith," which come with "full divine authority" (114). Kidner suggests speculation about how much is beside the point, since the stress is on understanding in vv. 2, 3, 7, 8, 12 (Kidner, 115).\f* which Yhwh had commanded Israel.
\v 2 So Ezra the priest brought the Torah before the assembly, from man to woman and every one who could understand to hear on the first day of the seventh month.
\v 3 And he read it before the square which was in front of the Water Gate from the light of day until the midday before the men and the women and those who could understand,\f + \fr 8.3: \ft Quite possibly this indicates that interpreters were involved, though it rather refers to the sequence of men, women, and all who could understand, that is, children (Fensham, 216).\f* and the ears of all the people listened to the book of the Torah.
\v 4 And Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden platform which they made for that purpose,\f + \fr 8.4: \ft The first pulpit? Fensham notes he would be visible to everyone and heard better (Fensham, 216).\f* and Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah stood beside him at his right hand and at his left Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.\f + \fr 8.4: \ft The identity of these people is unknown. Some speculate they were Levites, but elsewhere in this chapter the Levites are mentioned explicitly; clearly they were important, probably leaders in the community (Fensham, 216-17). Kidner suggests they successively read out portions of the law (Kidner, 115).\f*
\p
\v 5 And Ezra opened the scroll before the eyes of all the people for he was above all the people, and as he opened it\f + \fr 8.5: \ft Qal, Inf. Con., 3ms suffix, פתח.\f* all the people stood.\f + \fr 8.5: \ft Fensham attributes the standing to the reverence the people had for the word of God (Fensham, 216). Kidner: "What is strikingly apparent is the royal reception given to the Word of God. This day was to prove a turning-point. From now on, the Jews would be predominantly ‘the people of a book’" (Kidner, 115).\f*
\v 6 And Ezra blessed Yhwh the great God, and all the people answered, "Amen, Amen," by lifting\f + \fr 8.6: \ft Noun, common, singular, construct\f* their hands, and the knelt down\f + \fr 8.6: \ft Qal, Impf., 3mp, קדד.\f* and they bowed down\f + \fr 8.6: \ft Hisht., Impf., 3mp, חוה.\f* to Yhwh faces to the ground.\f + \fr 8.6: \ft Kidner notes that this assembly was not bibliolatry but rather worship directed to God (Kidner, 116).\f*
\v 7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, that is the Levites, made the people understand\f + \fr 8.7: \ft Hiph., Part., mp, בין.\f* the Torah\f + \fr 8.7: \ft This second list of thirteen names is that of the Levites tasked with explaining the law; we do not know how this was done - in smaller groups? Cf. 2 Chr 17:7-9; this scene could describe translating into Aramaic or interpreting (Fensham, 217). Fensham suggests that in v. 8 a distinction is made between translating (prš) and interpreting (bîn) (Fensham, 218). Kidner suggests the second group was free to move around, in contrast to the thirteen mentioned in v. 4. "The whole occasion emphasizes the clarity and candour of God’s dealings with his people" (Kidner, 116).\f* and the people were at their place.
\v 8 And they read in the book, in the Torah of God, explained,\f + \fr 8.8: \ft Pual, Part., ms, פרשׁ.\f* and set (?) insight and they understood the reading.\f + \fr 8.8: \ft Jensen and Grimmond define expository preaching with reference to this verse (The Archer and the Arrow, p. 39).\f*
\p
\v 9 And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who made the people understand, said to all the people, "This day is holy\f + \fr 8.9: \ft Note Lev 23:24 (Kidner, 117).\f* to Yhwh your God. Do not mourn, and do not weep." For all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the Torah.\f + \fr 8.9: \ft Fensham notes that the response of weeping was out of step with the mood of the festival (Fensham, 218-19).\f*
\v 10 And he said to them, "Go, eat fatty festive dishes\f + \fr 8.10: \ft ESV: fat, linking the meaning of this word to מִשְׁמָן. HALOT 649: plural from מִשְׁמָן, meaning "festive dishes" that are "prepared with much fat."\f* and drink sweet drinks\f + \fr 8.10: \ft Fensham notes that some people think this was wine (so ESV), but certainty is impossible (Fensham, 219).\f* and send portions to those who are not ready, for the day is holy to our Lord. And you shall not be grieved for the joy of Yhwh is your strength."\f + \fr 8.10: \ft Fensham: "The people must realize that in spite of their sins the Lord will be their strength, their protection during the coming year" (Fensham, 219).\f*
\v 11 And the Levites silenced all the people saying, "Quiet! For the day is holy; and do not be grieved."
\v 12 And all the people went to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great joy\f + \fr 8.12: \ft Holladay 353: "hold a feast."\f* for they understood\f + \fr 8.12: \ft "To have understood what God was saying was what made the occasion. It was a step from blind religiousness towards some degree of divine-human fellowship. Its full flowering would be in the new covenant with its assurance, ‘they shall all know me’; but the old covenant already held much promise of its successor" (Kidner, 118).\f* the words which they had made known to them.
