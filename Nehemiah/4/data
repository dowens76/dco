\c 4
\p
\v 1 And it happened when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall that his anger was kindled and he was very indignant so he mocked the Jews.
\v 2 And he spoke before his brothers and the wealthy of Samaria and he said, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they repair it for themselves? Will they offer sacrifice? Will they complete it in a day? Will they restore the stones to life from the heap of debris? And they are burned!"
\p
\v 3 And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him and he said "Even what they are building–if a fox went up on it, it would break through their stone wall!"
\p
\v 4 Listen, our God, for we are despised! Return their taunt to their own head and give them as spoil in the land of captivity.
\v 5 And do not cover over their guilt and do not wipe out their sin from before you for provoked (??) in front of the builders.
\p
\v 6 So we built the wall and the whole wall was joined together until half its height and it happened that the hearts of the people were for the work.
\p
\v 7 And it happened that when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the restoration of the walls of Jerusalem had gone up, that the breaches began to be closed up and their anger burned exceedingly.
\v 8 And all of them bound together (play on words with v. 6?) to come to fight against Jerusalem and to make a disturbance in it.
\p
\v 9 So we prayed to our God and we stationed a guard upon them day and night from before them.
\v 10 And Judah said, "The strength of the burden bearers (laborers?) is failing and the debris is abundant and we are not able to build on the wall."
\p
\v 11 And our adversaries said, "They do not know and they will not see until when we come into their midst and kill them and put an end to the work."
\p
\v 12 And it happened when the Jews who live near them came they said to us ten times, "From every place which you turn they will be upon us."
\v 13 And I stationed guards in the lowest places from behind the wall in open spaces and I stationed the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\v 14 And I looked and I rose and I spoke to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid from before them. Remember the Lord who is great and awesome and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your sisters, your wives, and your homes!"
\p
\v 15 And it happened when our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plot and all of us returned to the wall, each one to his own work.
\v 16 And it happened from that day that half of my young men continued on the work and half of them took hold of the spears, shields, and the bows, and the armor, and the captains were beind the all of the house of Judah.
\v 17 And the builders on the wall and those carrying burdens carried their load in one hand doing the work and one grasping their weapon.
\v 18 And the builders—each one tied his sword on his side while building and the one who sounds the horn was beside me.
\v 19 And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, "The work is great and extensive and we are separated on the wall, each man far from his brother.
\v 20 In the place which you hear the sound of the horn there gather to us; our God will fight for us!
\v 21 And we were doing the work and half of them holding spears from the rising of the dawn until the coming out of the stars.
\v 22 Also at that time I said to the people, "Let each man and his servant spend the night in the midst of Jerusalem and they will be a guard for us by night and work(er) by day.
\v 23 And neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard behind me, none of us stripped off their clothing, each man with his weapon even to the water.
