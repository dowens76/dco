\v 1 And the men of Ephraim said to him, “What is this thing you have done\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* to us to not call\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to us when you went\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* to fight\f + \ft Ni., IC\f* against Midian?” And they disputed\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* with him strongly.
\v 2 And he said to them, “What have I done\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* now like you? Aren’t the gleanings of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
\v 3 God has given\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the officers of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, into your hand and what I have I been able\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* to do\f + \ft Q, IC\f* like you?” Then their spirit relaxed\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* from upon him when he said\f + \ft Q, IC\f* this thing.
\v 4 And Gideon came\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to the Jordan and crossed over\f + \ft Q, Part.\f* , he and the three hundred men who were with him weary but pursuing\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* .
\v 5 And he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* loaves of bread to the people who are on my feet because they are weary and I am pursuing\f + \ft Q, Part.\f* after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.”
\v 6 And the officers of Succoth said, “Are the palms of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand that we should give\f + \ft Pi., Per\f* bread to your army?”
\v 7 And Gideon said, “That being so, when the Lord has given\f + \ft Q, IC\f* Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand then I shall trample on\f + \ft Q, Per., vwD\f* your flesh with the thorn bush of the wilderness and briers.”
\v 8 And he went up\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* from there to Penuel and he spoke\f + \ft Pi., Imp.\f* to them like this and the men of Penuel answered\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* him just as the men of Succoth answered\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* .
\v 9 And also he said to the men of Penuel saying, “When I have returned\f + \ft Q, IC\f* in peace I shall tear down\f + \ft Q, Imp., Jtn\f* this tower.”
\v 10 And Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their armies were with them about 15,000, all the the ones remaining\f + \ft Ni., Part.\f* from the army of the Easterners and 120,000 men who draw\f + \ft Q, Part., [lv\f* the sword had fallen\f + \ft Q, Part.\f* .
\v 11 And Gideon went up\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the way of the ones who live\f + \ft Q, Part.\f* in tents from the East of Nobah and Jogbehah and he struck\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the camp and the camp was unsuspecting.
\v 12 And Zebah and Zalmunna fled\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* and he pursued\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* after them and he captured\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the two kings of Midian Zebah and Zalmunna and he routed\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* the whole army.
\v 13 And Gideon son of Joash returned\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* from the battle from the ascent of Heres.
\v 14 And he captured\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* a lad from the men of Succoth and he asked him\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* and he wrote\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* for him the leaders of Succoth and her elders seventy seven men.
\v 15 And he came\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to the men of Succoth and he said, “Behold Zebah and Zalmunna for whom you taunted\f + \ft Pi., Per.\f* me saying, ‘Is the hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand that we should give\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* bread to your weary men?’”
\v 16 And he took\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the elders of the city and the thorns of the wilderness and the briers and he taught\f + \ft disciplined\f*\f + \ft Hi., Imp.\f* with them the men of Succoth.
\v 17 And he tore town\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the tower of Penuel and he killed\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the men of the city.
\v 18 And he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “Of what kind were the men whom you killed\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* at Tabor?” And they said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* “They were like you, each one like the form of the son of a king.”
\v 19 And he said, “They were my brothers sons of my mother; As the Lord is lives, if you had let them live\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* I would not kill\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* you.”
\v 20 And he said to Jeter his firstborn, “Arise\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* and kill\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* them” and the lad did not draw\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* his sword because he was afraid because he was still a lad.
\v 21 And Zebah and Zalmunna said “You yourself arise\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* and fall\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* on us because as the man so is his strength,” and Gideon arose\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* and he killed\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* Zebah and Zalmunna and he took\f + \ft Q, I mp.\f* the crescent ornaments which were on the necks of their camels.
\v 22 And the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* over us even you and also your son also the son of your son for you have delivered\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* us from the hand of Midian.”
\v 23 And Gideon said to them, “I shall not rule\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* over you and my son shall not rule\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* over you; the Lord shall rule\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* over you.”
\v 24 And Gideon said to them, “Let me ask\f + \ft Q, Co.\f* a request from you that you give\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* to me each a ring of his spoil” because they had rings of gold because they were Ishmaelites.
\v 25 And they said, “Surely\f + \ft Q, IA\f* we shall give\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* them,” and they spread out\f + \ft Q, Imp., crp\f* a garment and they cast\f + \ft Hi., Impf.\f* there each a ring of his spoil.
\v 26 And the weight of the rings of gold which he requested\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* was 1,700 gold alone besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments which were on the kings of Midian and alone from the necklaces which were on the necks of the camels.
\v 27 And Gideon made\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* it into an ephod and he set\f + \ft Hi., Imp., gxy\f* it in his city in Ophrah and all Israel played the harlot\f + \ft Q, Impf., hnz\f* there after him and it was a snare for Gideon and for his house.
\v 28 And Midian was subdued\f + \ft Ni., Imp., unK\f* before the Israelites and they did not again\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* lift\f + \ft Q, IC\f* their head and the land was quiet\f + \ft Q, Impf., fqv\f* forty years in the days of Gideon.
\v 29 And Jerubaal the son of Joash went and lived in his house.
\v 30 And Gideon had seventy sons who came out of his loins for he had many wives.
\v 31 And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore to him a son and he named him Abimelech.
\v 32 And Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and he was buried\f + \ft Niph., Impf.\f* in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\v 33 And when Gideon died the Israelites turned and played the harlot\f + \ft Qal, Impf., hnz\f* with the Baals and they set up Baal-berith as god for themselves.
\v 34 And the Israelites did not remember the Lord their God who delivered them from the hand of all their enemies all around.
\v 35 And they did not deal faithfully with the house of Jerubbaal\f + \ft Gideon\f* in accord with all the good which he had done with Israel.
