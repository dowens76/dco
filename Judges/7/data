\v 2 And the Lord said to Gideon, “The people who are with you are too many for me to give\f + \ft Q, IC\f* Midian into their hand lest Israel shall assume honor\f + \ft Hith., Impf.\f* over me saying, ‘My hand has delivered\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* me.’
\v 3 And now I pray call\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* in the ears of the people saying, ‘Whoever is afraid and is trembling, let him return and he shall depart\f + \ft Q, Impf., rpx\f* from Mount Gilead,’” and 22,000 from the people returned and 10,000 remained\f + \ft Ni., Per.\f* .
\v 4 And the Lord said to Gideon, “Still the people are many; bring them down\f + \ft Hi., Impv.\f* to the waters and I shall test them\f + \ft Q, Impf., [rx\f* for you there and when I say to you ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you and all of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.’”
\v 5 And he brought the people down to the waters and the Lord said to Gideon, “Everyone who licks up\f + \ft Q, Impf., qql\f* the water with his tongue as the dog licks, you shall set\f + \ft Hi., Impf. gxy\f* him apart and\f + \ft from?\f* everyone who bows down\f + \ft Q, Impf., urk\f* on his knee to drink\f + \ft Q, IC\f* .”
\v 6 And the number of the ones who were lapping with their hand to their mouths was 300 men and all the people who remained bowed down on their knees to drink\f + \ft Q, IC\f* water.
\v 7 And the Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped I shall deliver you and I shall give Midian in your hand and all the people will go, each man to his place.”
\v 8 And they took the provison of the people in their hand and their ram’s horns and he sent\f + \ft Pi., Per.\f* every man of Israel each to his tent and the three hundred men he kept\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* and the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
\v 9 And on that night that the Lord said to him, “Arise, go down into the camp because I have given it into your hand.
\v 10 And if you are afraid\f + \ft Q, Part.\f* to go down\f + \ft Q, IC\f* , go down, you and Purah your servant to the camp.
\v 11 And you shall hear what they shall say and afterward your hands shall be strong\f + \ft Qal, Impf.\f* and you shall go down in the camp,” so he and Purah his servant went down to the edge of the ones who were organized for war\f + \ft Q, Pass. Part., vmj\f* who were in the camp.
\v 12 And Midian amd Amalek and all the Easterners were lying in the valley as locusts for an abundance and of their camels there was no number, like sand which is on the shore of the sea for an abundance.
\v 13 And Gideon came and behold a man was recounting a dream to his friend and he said, “Behold I had a dream and behold a round loaf of barley bread overturned itself\f + \ft Hith., Part.\f* into the camp of Midian and it came to the tent and it struck it\f + \ft Hi., Impf.\f* and it fell and it turned it up and the tent fell.”
\v 14 And his friend answered and said, “This is nothing but the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given Midian and all the camp into his hand.”
\v 15 And when Gideon heard\f + \ft Q, IC\f* the recounting\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down and returned to the camp of Israel and he said, “Arise because the Lord has given the camp of Midian into your hand.”
\v 16 And he divided\f + \ft Q, Impf., hxj\f* the three hundred men into three companies and he gave horns and empty jars in the hand of all of them and there were torches in the midst of the jars.
\v 17 And he said to them “From me you shall see and so you shall do, and behold I am coming to the edge of the camp and as I do so you shall do.
\v 18 And I shall blow the horn, I and all who are with me, you shall blow the horns as you are around all the camp and you shall say, ‘For the Lord and for Gideon.’”
\v 19 And Gideon and a hundred men with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch surely they had set up\f + \ft Hi., IA\f*\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* the ones who were watching\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* and they blew in the horns and shattered\f + \ft Q, IA, Jpn\f* the jars which were in their hands.
\v 20 And the three companies blew the horns and they broke the jars and they took hold of the torches in their left hand and the trumpets in their right hand to blow\f + \ft Q, IC\f* and they cried “A sword for the Lord and for Gideon.”
\v 21 And each man stood below it around the camp and all the camp ran\f + \ft JWr\f* and they shouted\f + \ft Q Impf., u^Wr\f* and fled.
\v 22 And they blew the three hundred horns and the Lord set the sword of each man against his neighbor and in all of the camp and the camp fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah as far as the edge of Abelmeholah at Tabbath.
\v 23 And the men of Israel were summoned\f + \ft Ni., Impf., qux\f* from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian.
\v 24 And Gideon sent messengers in all the hill country of Ephraim saying, “Come down to meet Midian and capture\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* from them the waters as far as Beth-Barah and the Jordan,” and all the men of Ephraim were called summoned and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.
\v 25 And they captured two of the officers of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb and they pursued\f + \ft them\f* to Midian and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.
