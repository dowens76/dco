\v 1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to the brothers of his mother and he spoke to them and to all the clan of the house of his mother’s father saying,
\v 2 “Speak, now, in the hearing of all the men of Shechem, ‘What is better for you, that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, shall rule over you or one man rule over you?’ and remember that your I am your bone and your flesh.”
\v 3 And his mother’s brothers spoke for him in the hearing of all the men of Shechem all these words and it was in their heart to follow after Abimelech for they said, “He is our brother.”
\v 4 And they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-Berith and Abimelech hired with them worthless and reckless men and they went after him.
\v 5 And he came to the house of his father at Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men on one stone, and Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, was left because he hid himself\f + \ft Niphal\f* .
\v 6 And all the men of Shechem and all the Beth-Millo gathered and they came and made Abimelech king at the terebinth standing\f + \ft ?\f* which is in Shechem.
\v 7 And they told Jotham and he went and stood at the top of Mount Gerizim and lifted his voice and called and said to them, “Listen to me, men of Shechem, and God will listen to you.
\v 8 The trees surely went to anoint a king over them and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’
\v 9 And the olive tree said to them, ‘Shall I cease my fatness by which they honor God and menand shall I go to wave over the trees?’
\v 10 And the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come reign over us!’
\v 11 and the fig tree said to them, ‘Shall I cease my sweetness and my good fruit and go to wave over the trees?’
\v 12 And the trees said to the vine, ‘You come reign over us!’
\v 13 And the vine said to them, “Shall I cease from my new wine which cheers God and men and shall I go to wave over the trees?’
\v 14 And all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come reign over us!’
\v 15 And the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me as king over you, come seek refuge in my shade and if not, may fire come out from the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon!’
\v 16 And Now, if in truth and integrity you have dealt and make Abimelech king and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and with his house and if you have dealt with him as his hands deserve.
\v 17 For my father fought for you and cast\f + \ft risked\f* his life for\f + \ft you\f* and delivered you from the hand of Midian.
\v 18 But you have risen against the house of my father this day and you have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and you have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem for he is your relative.
\v 19 And if in truth and integrity you have dealt with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech and let him also rejoice in you.
\v 20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and let it consume the men of Shechem and Beth Millo and let fire come out of the men of Shechem and from Beth Millo and let it consume Abimelech.”
\v 21 And Jotham escaped and fled and he came to Beer and lived there because of Abimelech his brother.
\v 22 And Abimelech ruled over Israel three years.
\v 23 And God sent an evil spirit betweeen Abimelech and the men of Shechem and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech.
\v 24 so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come and their blood might be placed on Abimelech their brother who killed them and on the men of Shechem who strengthened his hand to kill his brothers.
\v 25 And the men of Shechem set for him, lying in wait at the tops of the mountains and they robbed all who passed by them on the road and it was told to Abimelech.
\v 26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives and they passed by into Shechem and the men of Shechem trusted in him.
\v 27 And they went out to the field and cutt off the grapes of their vineyards and tread upon them and they made rejoicing\f + \ft ?\f* and they came into the house of their god and they at and drank and cursed Abimelech.
\v 28 . And Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we might serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal and Zebul is his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem but why should we serve him?
\v 29 And who will give this people in my hand and I will turn Abimelech aside.” And to Abimelech he said, “Increase your army and come out.”
\v 30 And Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed and his anger burned.
\v 31 And he send messengers to Abimelech treacherously saying, “Behold, Gaal son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem and behold they are besieging\f + \ft ?\f* the city against you.
\v 32 And now rise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.
\v 33 And in the morning as the sun rises, you will get up early and make a dash for the city and behold it and the people who are with him will come out to you and you will do to him as your hand finds.”
\v 34 And Abimelech rose by night with all the people who were with him and they lay in wait against Shechem in four companies.
\v 35 And Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city and Abimelech rose up and the people who were with him from the ambush.
\v 36 And Gaal saw the people and he said Zebul, “Behold people are coming down from the tops of the mountains,” and Zebul said to him, “The shadow of the mountains you see as men.
\v 37 And Gaal continued to speak and he said, “Behold, people are coming down from the highest part of the land and one company comes by the way of the diviners oak.”
\v 38 And Zebul said to him, “Where then is your mouth with which you spoke, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you hated? Go out now and fight them!”
\v 39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem and he fought with Abimelech.
\v 40 And Abimelech pursued him and he fled before him and many fell slain up to the entrance of the gate.
\v 41 And Abimelech remained at Arumah and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives from living in Shechem.
\v 42 And on the next day the people went out to the field and they told this to Abimelech.
\v 43 And he took the people and divided them into three companies and he lay in wait in the field and he saw and behold the people went out of the city and he arose against them and struck them.
\v 44 And Abimelech and the companies who were with him dashed and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city and two of the companies dashed against all who were in the field and struck them.
\v 45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day and he captured the city and the people who were in it he killed and he pulled down the city and sowed it with salt.
\v 46 And all the men of the tower of Shechem heard, they came into the underground chamber of the house of El-berith.
\v 47 And it was told to Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem had collected themselves.
\v 48 And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him, and Abimelech took axes in his hand and he cut down a branch of the trees and lifted it and placed it on his shoulder, and he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do like me.”
\v 49 And also all the people cut down, each man his own branch, and they came after Abimelech and placed them on the underground chamber and burned the chamber over them with fire and also all the men of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.
\v 50 And Abimelech came to Thebez and camped against Thebez and captured it.
\v 51 And a strong tower was in the middle of the city and all the men and women and the leaders of the city fled there and and they shut the door behind. And They went up on the roof of the tower.
\v 52 And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the entrance of the tower to burn it with fire.
\v 53 And a woman threw a millstone on the head of Abimelech and it crushed his skull.
\v 54 And he called in hased to the young man bearing his things and he said to him, “Draw out your sword and kill me lest they say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” And his young man pierced him through and he died.
\v 55 And the men of Israel saw that Abimelech had died and they went each man to his place.
\v 56 And God returned the wickedness of Abimelech which he did to his father to kill his seventy brothers.
\v 57 And all the wickedness of the men of Shechem God returned on their heads and the curse of Jotham, son of Jerubbaal, came to them.
