\v 1 And the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord and the Lord gave them\f + \ft Q, Imp., 3ms, 3mp suff.\f* into the hand of the Midian seven years.
\v 2 And the hand of Midian was strong\f + \ft Q, Imp., 3fs, zzu\f* over Israel; from before Midian the Israelites made for themselves caves which were in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
\v 3 And it came to pass if Israel had sown that Midian went up and the Amalekites and the Easterners and they came up against them\f + \ft Israel\f* .
\v 4 And they camped\f + \ft Q, Imp., 3mp, hnj\f* against them and they destroyed\f + \ft Hi., Impf., 3mp, tjv\f* the produce of the land until you have come\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to Gaza and they did not leave over\f + \ft Hi., Impf.\f* food in Israel and lamb and bull and donkey.
\v 5 Because they and their cattle came up and their tents they came as an abundance of locusts for a multitude and for them and for their camels there was not counting\f + \ft Pi., Part., ms\f* and they came in the land to destroy it\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* .
\v 6 And Israel was exceedingly weak\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, lld\f* from before Midian and the Israelites cried out to the Lord.
\v 7 And when the Israelites cried out to the Lord because of Midian
\v 8 the Lord sent a man, a prophet, to the Israelites and he said to them “Thus the Lord the God of Israel says, “I have brought you up from Egypt and I brought you out from the house of slavery.
\v 9 And I delivered\f + \ft Hiph., Impf, 1cs, lxn\f* you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors and drove them away\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 1cs, vrg\f* from before you and I gave to you their land.
\v 10 And I said\f + \ft Qal, Juss., 1cs\f* to you, ‘I am the Lord your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling,’ and you have not obeyed me.”
\v 11 And a messenger of the Lord came and he sat under the oak which is in Ophrah which was to Joash the Abiezrite and his son Gideon was beating\f + \ft Q, Part., ms, fbj\f* wheat in the winepress to hide\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* from before Midian.
\v 12 And the messenger of the Lord appeared\f + \ft Ni., Impf.\f* to him and he said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to him “The Lord is with you, mighty man of valor.”
\v 13 And Gideon said to him, “I pray, my Lord, if the Lord is with us why has all of this found us\f + \ft Q, Per., 3fs\f* and where are all His wonders which our fathers recounted\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* to us saying, “Did not the Lord bring us up\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* from Egypt and now the Lord has left\f + \ft Q, Per., 3ms, 3ms suff., vfn\f* us and he has given us\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* into the hand of Midian.”
\v 14 And the Lord turned\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to him and he said, “God in this your strength and you shall deliver\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?
\v 15 And he said to him, “I pray, my Lord, how shall I deliver\f + \ft Hi., Imp.\f* Israel? Behold my clan is weak in Manasseh and I am the young one in my father’s house.
\v 16 And the Lord said to him, “Because I shall be with you, you shall smite\f + \ft 2, M, S, Hi., Per.\f* Midian as one man.”
\v 17 And he said to him, “If I pray I have found\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* favor in your eyes then make\f + \ft 2, M, S, Hi., Per.\f* a sign for me who you are speaking\f + \ft M, S, Pi., Part.\f* with me.
\v 18 Please do not depart\f + \ft Qal, Juss., 2ms, vwm\f* from this until I come to you and I bring my offering and I lay\f + \ft Hiph., Perf., 1cs, jwn\f* it before you.” And he said, “I will sit until you return.”
\v 19 And Gideon came and he made a she goat\f + \ft kid\f* and an ephah of flour unleavened bread; he placed\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the flesh in the basket and he placed\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the broth in the cooking pot and he brought them out\f + \ft Hi., Imp.\f* to him to under the oak and he drew near\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* .
\p
\v 20 And the angel of God said to him, “Take\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* the flesh and the unleavened bread and cause to rest\f + \ft M, S, Hi., Impv.\f* unto this rock and pour out\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* the broth,” and he did\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* thus.
\v 21 And the angel of the Lord stretched out\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the end of the staff which was in his hand and he touched\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the flesh and the unleavened bread and the fire went up\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Imp.\f* from the rock and consumed\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Imp.\f* the flesh and the unleavened bread and the angel of the Lord went\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* from his eyes.
\v 22 And Gideon saw\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* that he was an angel of the Lord and Gideon said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* “Alas Lord God because I have seen\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* an angel of the Lord face to face.”
\v 23 And the Lord said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to him, “Peace to you, do not fear\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* you shall not die\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* .
\v 24 And Gideon built\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* an altar there for the Lord and the Lord called\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* it the Lord is peace; until this day it is still in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
\p
\v 25 And that night the Lord said\f + \ft Q, Imp. ,VC\f* to him “Take\f + \ft Q, Impv.\f* the young bull which is your father’s and the second bull seven years old and you shall destroy\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the altar of Baal which is your father’s and you shall cut down\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the Asherah which is near it.
\v 26 And you shall build\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* an altar for the Lord your God upon the top of this stronghold in order and you shall take\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the second bull and you shall offer a burnt offering\f + \ft Hi., Per.\f* with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* .”
\v 27 And Gideon took\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* ten men from his servants and he did\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* as the Lord spoke to him and it came to pass because he feared\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* his father’s house and the men of the city to do it\f + \ft Q, IC\f* by day that he did it\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* by night.
\v 28 When the men of the city got up\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* in the morning, behold the altar of Baal was torn down\f + \ft Pu., Per., Jtn\f* and the Asherah which was near it was cut down\f + \ft 3, F, S, Qal Pass., Per.\f* and the second bull was offered\f + \ft Hoph., Perf., 3ms, hlu\f* as a burnt offering upon the altar which was built\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part., ms, hnb\f* .
\v 29 And they said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to each other “Who did\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* this thing?” And they sought\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* and they sought\f + \ft Pi., Imp.\f* and they said\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* “Gideon son of Joash did\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* this thing.” And the men of the city said\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* to Joash, “Bring out\f + \ft M, S, Hi., Imp.\f* your son and he shall die\f + \ft Q, Imp.onj.\f* because he tore down\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the altar of Baal and because he cut down\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* the Asherah which is near it.”
\v 31 And Joash said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to all who stood\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* against him, “Shall you contend\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* for Baal or shall you deliver\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* him? Whoever contends\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* for him shall be killed\f + \ft Hoph., Imp.\f* by the morning; if he is god he shall contend\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* for himself because he tore down\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* his altar.”
\v 32 And he called\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* him Jerubbaal on that day saying, “Let Baal contend\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* with himself,” because he tore down his altar.
\v 33 And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the East were gathered\f + \ft Ni., Per., 3, C, P\f* together and they passed through\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* and they camped\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* in the valley of Jezreel.
\v 34 And the Spirit of the Lord clothed\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Per.\f* Gideon and he blew\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* in a ram’s horn and the Abiezrites were called out\f + \ft NI., Imp.\f* after him.
\v 35 And he sent\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* messengers in all Manasseh and also they were called\f + \ft Ni., Imp.\f* after him and he sent\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* messengers in Asher and in Zebulun and in Naphtali and they came up\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* to their call\f + \ft Q, IC\f* .
\v 36 And Gideon said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to God, “If You are saving\f + \ft M, S, Hi., Part.\f* Israel by my hand as You have spoken\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* ,
\v 37 behold I am placing\f + \ft Hi., Part., M, S\f* a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if dew shall be\f + \ft Q, Imp., 3, M, S\f* on the fleece only and it is dry on all the ground then I shall know\f + \ft Q, Per., 1, C, S\f* that You shall deliver\f + \ft Hi., Imp.\f* Israel by my hand as you have spoken\f + \ft Q, Per.\f* .”
\v 38 And so it came to pass and he got up\f + \ft Hi., Imp.\f* the next day and he pressed\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* the fleece and dew squeezed out\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* from the fleece, the bowl was full of water.
\v 39 And Gideon said\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* to God, “Do not let you anger burn\f + \ft Q, J.\f* with me that I might surely speak\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Co\f* a second time; I urge\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Co.\f* I pray only this time on the fleece it shall be dry in the fleece only and upon all the ground there shall be dew.”
\v 40 And God did\f + \ft Q, Imp.\f* thus that night and it was dry in the fleece only and upon all the ground there was dew.
