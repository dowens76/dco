\v 2 And Jephthah said to them, “I was the man of great strife and my people and the Ammonites and I called you and you did not save me from their hand.
\v 3 And I saw that you would not deliver and I placed my life in my hand and crossed over to the Ammonites and the Lord gave them into my hand. So why do you come up to me this day to fight against me?
