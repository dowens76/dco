\v 1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi with the overseers and deacons.
\v 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 I give thanks to my God at every remembrance of you,
\v 4 always in my every prayer for all of you, making prayer with joy,
\v 5 because of your fellowship for the Gospel from the first day until now,
\v 6 being persuaded of this, that the one who began a good work in you will finish until the day of Christ Jesus.
\v 7 Just as it is right for me to think this on behalf of all of you because I have you in my heart, in my bonds and in my defense and confirmation of the Gospel, you all are my partners of grace.
\v 8 For God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affections of Christ Jesus.
\v 9 And this I pray, that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and in all discernment
\v 10 so that you may test what is carried through (?), in order that you might be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
\v 11 being filled with the fruit of righteousness which is through Christ to the glory and praise of God.
