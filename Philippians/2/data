\v 1 Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any consolation of love, if there is fellowship of the Spirit, if there is any affection and compassion,
\v 2 fulfill \f + A, A, Imp., 2, P\f* my joy in order that you might think \f + Pr., A, S, 2, P\f* this thing, while having \f + Pr., A, Part., M, P, N\f* the same love, harmonious, while thinking \f + Pr., A, Part., M, P, N\f* the one,
\v 3 nothing according to selfish ambition nor according to vanity but in humility regard \f + Pr., M, Imp., m, P, N\f* one another as better than \f + Pr., A, Part., M, P, A\f* yourselves,
\v 4 do not each look out for \f + Pr., A, Part., M., P, N\f* yourselves but also each of others.
\v 5 Think \f + Pr., A, Imp., 2, P\f* this in you who also are in Christ Jesus,
\q1
\v 6 Who while he existed \f + Pr., A, Part., M, S, N\f* in the form of God
\q1 He did not regard \f + A, M, Ind., 3, S\f* a prize
\q1 To be equal to God,
\q1
\v 7 but he emptied \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f* himself
\q1 By taking \f + A, A, Part., M, S, N\f* the form of a slave
\q1 And by becoming \f + A, M, Part., M, S, N\f* in the likeness of men;
\q1 and was found \f + A, P, Part., M, S, N\f* in the form as a man
\q1
\v 8 he humbled \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f* himself
\q1 By becoming \f + A, M, Part., M, S, N\f* obedient until death,
\q1 But death of a cross.
\q1
\v 9 Therefore also God raised him to the loftiest height \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f*
\q1 And gave freely \f + A, M, Ind., 3, S\f* to him the name
\q1 Which is above every name,
\q1
\v 10 In order that by the name of Jesus
\q1 Every knee of heavenly beings and earthly beings and
\q1 subterranean beings should bow \f + A, A, S, 3, S\f*
\q1
\v 11 And every tongue should confess \f + A, M, S, 3, S\f* that
\q1 The Lord Jesus Christ
\q1 Is in the glory of God the Father.
\p
\v 12 So that, my beloved ones, just as always you obeyed \f + A, A, Ind., 2, P\f*, not as in my coming only but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling accomplish \f + Pr., M, Imp., 2, P\f* the salvation of yourselves;
\v 13 for God is \f + Pr., Ind., 3, S\f* the one working \f + Pr., A, Part., M, S, N\f* in you and the one to will \f + Pr., A, Inf.\f* and the one to work \f + Pr., A, Inf.\f* on behalf of His good pleasure.
\v 14 Do \f + Pr., A, Imp., 2, P\f* all things without grumblings and disputes,
\v 15 in order that you might become blameless and pure, unblemished children of God in the middle of a crooked generation also being perverted \f + A, P, Part., F, S, G\f*, in which you are shining \f + Pr., M, Ind., 2, P\f* as stars in the world,
\v 16 while holding fast \f + Pr., A, Part., M, P, N\f* to the word of life, in a bost for me in the day of Christ, because I did not run \f + A, A, Ind., 1, S\f* in vain nor did I labor \f + A, A, Ind., 1, S\f* in vain.
\v 17 But if also I offered up \f + Pr., P, Ind., 1, S\f* at the sacrifice and sacrificial service of your faith, I am rejoicing \f + Pr., A, Ind., 1, S\f* and I am rejoicing \f + Pr., A, Ind., 1, S\f* with all of you;
\v 18 but the same also you are rejoicing \f + Pr., A, Ind., 2, P\f* and you are rejoicing together \f + Pr., A, Ind., 2, P\f* with me.
\v 19 But I hope \f + Pr., A, Ind., 1, S\f* in the Lord Jesus to quickly send \f + A, A, Inf.\f* Timothy to you, in order that also I might be sincerely glad \f + Pr., A, S, 1, S\f* because I know \f + A, A, Part., M, S, N\f* the things concerning you.
\v 20 For I am having \f + Pr., A, Ind., 1, S\f* no one of like mind, whoever shall genuinely care for \f + F, A, Ind., 3, S\f* the things concerning you;
\v 21 for all men are seeking the things of themselves, not the things of Jesus Christ.
\v 22 But you are knowing \f + Pr., A, Ind., 2, P\f* his character, because he served as a child to a father with me in the Gospel.
\v 23 Therefore on the one hand I am hoping \f + Pr., A, Ind., 1, S\f* to send \f + A, A, Inf.\f* this one as soon as I should see \f + A, A, S, 1, S\f* the things concerning me immediately;
\v 24 but I have been persuaded \f + Per., A, Ind., 1, S\f* by the Lord that also I myself shall come \f + F, M, Ind., 1, S\f* soon.
\v 25 But I thought \f + A, M, Ind., 1, S\f* it neccessary to send \f + A, A, Inf.\f* to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier but your apostle and servant of my need,
\v 26 since he was earnestly desiring \f + Pr., A, Part., M, S, N\f* all of you and he was distressed \f + Pr., A, Part., M, S, N\f*, because you heard \f + A, A, Ind., 2, P\f* that he was sick \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f*.
\v 27 For also he was sick \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f* coming near to death; but God was merciful \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f* to him, but not him only but also me, in order that I might not have \f + A, A, S, 1, S\f* grief upon grief.
\v 28 Therefore I sent \f + A, A, Ind., 1, S\f* with haste, in order that when you see \f + A, A, Part., M, P, N\f* him again you might rejoice and I might be free from anxiety.
\v 29 Therefore expect \f + Pr., M, Imp., 2, P\f* him in the Lord with all joy and you are having \f + Pr., A, Ind., 2, P\f* such honored ones \f + ?\f*,
\v 30 because he drew near \f + A, A, Ind., 3, S\f* until death because of the work of Christ by risking \f + A, M, Part., M, S, N\f* his soul, in order that he might make complete \f + A, A, S, 3, S\f* the thing that was lacking in your service to me.
