\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin.

\v 5 And it came to pass that all of the lives that came out of\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part., Const.\f* the loins of Jacob were seventy lives and Joseph was in Egypt.
\v 6 And Joseph and all his brothers and all of that generation died\f + \ft M, S, Q, Imp., vc\f* .
\v 7 And the sons of Israel bore fruit\f + \ft C, P, Q, Per.\f* and they swarmed\f + \ft C, P, Q, Per.\f* and they increased\f + \ft C, P, Q, Per.\f* and they were exceedingly vast\f + \ft C, P, Q, Per.\f* and the land was filled\f + \ft M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* with them.
\p
\v 8 And a new king arose\f + \ft M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* over Egypt who did not know\f + \ft M, S, Q, Per.,\f* Joseph.
\v 9 And he said\f + \ft M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* unto his people, "Behold the people of the sons of Israel are many and they are mightier than we are.
\v 10 Come\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* let us be wise\f + \ft 1, C, P, Hith., Imp., Coh.\f* for him lest he shall increase\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and it shall happen that they shall call\f + \ft 3, F, P, Q, Imp.\f* a war and even he shall be added\f + \ft 3, M, S, Ni., Per., VC\f* upon our enemies and he shall fight\f + \ft 3, M, S, N., Per., VC\f* against us and he shall rise\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* from the earth."
\v 11 And they put\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* upon him officials of forced labor in order to oppress them\f + \ft Pi., IC\f* in their burden and they built\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* a city of storehouses for Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses.
\v 12 And as they oppressed\f + \ft 3, M, P, Pi., Imp.\f* him so he increased\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and so he spread out\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and they felt a sickening dread\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* from before the children of Israel.
\v 13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Imp., VC\f* with violence.
\v 14 And they made their lives bitter\f + \ft 3, M, P, Pi., Imp., VC\f* with hard labor with clay and with bricks and with all work in the field with all their work which they worked\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* with them with violence.
\v 15 And the king of Egypt said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to the Hebrew midwives who were first named Shiphrah and second named Puah,
\v 16 and he said "When you help the Hebrew women to give birth\f + \ft Pi., IC\f* and you see\f + \ft 2, F, P, Q, Per., VC\f* on the potters wheel if it is a son then you shall kill\f + \ft 2, F, P, Hi., Per., VC\f* him and if it is a daughter she shall live.
\v 17 And the midwives feared\f + \ft 3, F, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* God and they did not do\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* as the king of Egypt told\f + \ft 3, M, S, Pi., Per.\f* to them and they let the boys live\f + \ft 3, F, P, Pi., Imp., VC\f* .
\v 18 And the king of Egypt called\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* the midwives and he said to them, "Why did you do\f + \ft 2, F, P, Q, Per.\f* this deed and let the boys live\f + \ft 2, F, P, Pi., Imp., VC\f* ?
\v 19 And the midwives said\f + \ft 3, F, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* to Pharaoh that, "the women of Egypt are not live the Hebrew women because they are vigorous; before the midwife shall come\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Imp.\f* to them they shall give birth\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per., VC\f* ."
\v 20 And God caused good\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp., VC\f* for the midwives and the people increased\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* and they became exceedingly vast\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* .
\v 21 And it happened because the midwives feared\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* God that he made\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* for them households.
\v 22 And Pharaoh commanded\f + \ft 3, M, S, Pi., Imp., VC\f* to all his people saying, "Every son which is born throw him down\f + \ft M, P, H., Imp.\f* to the Nile and every daughter you shall let live\f + \ft 2, F, P, Hi., Imp.\f* .
