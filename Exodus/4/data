\v 1 And Moses answered\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* and he said, "And suppopse they will not believe\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* me, and they shall not listen\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* to my voice because they shall say 'The Lord has not appeared\f + \ft 2, M, S, Ni., Per.\f* to you'?"
\p
\v 2 And the Lord said to him, "What is this in your hand?"
\p And he said, "A staff."
\p
\v 3 And he said, "Cast it\f + \ft M, S, Hi., Impv.\f* to the ground."
\p And he cast it\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp., VC\f* to the ground, and it became a serpent and Moses fled\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* from it.
\v 4 And the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* your hand and grasp\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* it by the tail."
\p And he stretched out\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* his hand and he grew strong\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* in it and it became a staff in his hand. "This is in order that they shall believe\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* that the Lord, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you."
\v 6 And the Lord said to him, "Again, please bring\f + \ft M, S, Hi., Impv.\f* your hand in the fold of your cloak."
\p And he brought his hand in his cloak and he brought it out\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., IMP., VC\f* and behold, his hand was like snow from leprosy.
\v 7 And he said, "Return\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Impv.\f* your hand to your cloak."
\p And he returned his hand to his cloal and he brought it out from his cloak and behold it had returned as his flesh.
\p
\v 8 "And it shall happen if they shall not believe\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* even for these two signs then they shall not obey you\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* and you shall take\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Per.\f* from the waters of the Nile and you shall pour\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Per.\f* on the dry ground and it shall happen that the waters which you shall take\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* from the Nile and it shall become blood on the dry ground.
\p
\v 10 And Moses said to the Lord, "Please, my Lord, I am not a man of words even from yesterday even from the day before even from the time you have spoken\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to your servant, because I have a heavy mouth and a heavy tongue."
\p
\v 11 And the Lord said to him, "Who gave\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* a mouth to man or who shall make him dumb or deaf or open his eyes or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?
\v 12 And now go\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* and I shall be with your mouth and I shall throw you what you shall speak."
\p
\v 13 And he said, "Please, my Lord, send\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* by the hand you shall send\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* ."
\p
\v 14 And the anger of the Lord burned\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* against Moses and he said, "Why not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he shall surely speak and even behold he is going out\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* to meet you and when he sees you\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* he will rejoice\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* in his heart.
\v 15 And You shall speak to him and you shall put the words in his mouth and I shall be with your mouth and with is mouth and I shall through you what you shall answer.
\v 16 And he sall speak for you to the people and it shall happen that he shall be a mouth for you and you shall like God to him.
\v 17 And take this staff in your hand which you shall make with it the signs.
\p
\v 18 And Moses went\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* and he returned to Jethro, his wife's father, and he said to him, "Please let me go\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Coh. Imp.\f* and let me return to my brothers who are in Egypt and I shall see\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp., Vconj.\f* the ones who are still living."
\p And Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
\p
\v 19 And the Lord said to Moses, "Go from Midian, return to Egypt for all the men who were seeking\f + \ft M, P, Pi., Part.\f* your life have died."
\v 20 So Moses took his wife and his son and he mounted them\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp., VC\f* on the donkey and he returned to the land of Egypt and Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
\v 21 And the Lord said to Moses, "When you go\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to return to Egypt, see all the wonders which I shall ordain through your hand and I shall do them before Pharaoh and I shall strengthen his heart and he shall not send out the people. So you shall say to Pharoah "This is what The Lord has said, Israel is my firstborn son. And he has said to you, 'Send my son away so he will worship me." But you refused to send him away. Behold I am killing your firstborn son.'"
\p
\v 24 And it happened on the way in the lodging place that the Lord met him\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* and he sought to kill him.
\v 25 And Zipporah took a rock and she cut the foreskin of her son and she touched to his feet and she said, "You are a bridegroom of bloodshed to me."
\v 26 And he resisted from him, then she said bridegroom of bloodshed for the descendents.
\v 27 And the Lord said to Aaron, "Go to meet Moses, to the wilderness." And he went and he met him on the mountain of God and he kissed him.
\v 28 And Moses told to Aaron all the words of the Lord which he sent him and all the signs which he commanded.
\v 29 And Moses and Aaron went and they gathered all the elders of the children of Israel.
\v 30 And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord spole to Moses and he did the signts for the eyes of the people.
\v 31 And when the people believed and they heard that the Lord had payed attention to the children of Israel and that he saw the afflictions, they bowed down and they worshiped him.
