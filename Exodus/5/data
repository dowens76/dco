\v 1 And after Moses and Aaron came, they said to Pharaoh, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: 'Let my people go and make a pilgramage to me in the wilderness.'"
\p
\v 2 And Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord whom I shall obey him to et Israel go? I do not know the Lord and moreover I shall not let Israel go."
\p
\v 3 And they said, "The God of the Hebrews has called upon us. Please let us go a way three days in the wilderness and let us sacrifice to the Lord our God lest he should fall upon us with the word or the sword.
\p
\v 4 And the King of Egypt said to them, "Why have Moses and Aaron led the people from their work?! Go to your burdens." And Pharaoh said, "They are numerous, now more than the people of the land and they are causing them to cease from their burdens." And Pharaoh commanded on that day the taskmasters over the people and his officers saying,
\v 7 "You shall not add to give straw to the people to make bricks as formerly. They shall go and gather stubble for themselves for straw
\v 8 and the proportion of the bricks which they are making formerly you shall set upon them. You shall not diminish from it because they are relaxing. Therefore they are crying out saying, 'Let us go sacrifice to our God.' You shall make the work heavy upon the men and they shall do it and they shall not regard words of deception."
\p
\v 10 And the oppressors of the people and his officers went out and they said to the people saying, "Thus Pharaoh has said, 'There is not for me to give to you straw. You go take for yourselves straw from which you shall find because there is not a word diminishing from your work."
\v 12 And the people scattered in all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 And the taskmasters were pressing saying, "Complete your work for the day on its day as when there was straw."
\v 14 And the officers of the children of Israel were struck down when the taskmasters of Pharaoh set upon them saying, "Why have you not completed the portion of bricks as formerly even yesterday or today?"
\p
\v 15 And the officers of the children of Israel came and they cried to Pharaoh saying, "Why have you done thus to your servants? Three is not straw which has been given to your servants and they are saying to us "Make bricks," and behold our servants are being struck and your people have gone wrong."
\p
\v 17 And he said "Lazy, you are lazy. Therefore you are saying, "Let us go, let us sacrifice to the Lord.
\v 18 And now go, work, and straw shall not be given to you and you shall give the measure of bricks."
\p
\v 19 And the officers of the children of Israel feared them in evil saying, "You shall not shave from your bricks a matter of day in day\f + \ft ????\f*."
\v 20 And they met Moses and Aaron standing to meet them when they came out from being with Pharaoh and they said to them, "May the Lord shall look upon you and may he judge you who have caused us to be a stench in the eyes of Pharaoh and his servants to give a sword in their hand to kill us."
\p
\v 22 And Moses returned to the Lord and he said, "Lord, why have you caused evil for this people? Why have you sent me for this? From the time I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name evil has been to this people and you have surely not saved your people!
