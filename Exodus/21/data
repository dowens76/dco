\c 21

\v 1 These are the judgments which you shall set before them:
\v 2 when you acquire a Hebrew servant, six years he will serve but on the seventh he will go out free for nothing.
\v 3 If with himself he comes, with himself he will go out if he is the husband of a woman then his wife will go out with him.
\v 4 If his master should give him a wife and the wife should bear him sons or daughters then her children will be her masterÃ¢ÂÂs and he will go out by himself.
\v 5 And if the servant will surely say, Ã¢ÂÂI love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free,Ã¢ÂÂ
\v 6 then his master will bring him near to God and bring him near to the door or to the doorpost and his master will pierce his ear with an awl and he will serve him permanently.
\v 7 And if a man sells his daughter for a maidservant she will not go out like male servants go out.
\v 8 If she is displeasing in the eyes of her master who appointed her for himself then he shall let her be ransomed\f + \ft Hiph., Per., 3ms, 3fs suff., hdp\f* . To a foreign people he does not have dominion to sell her in/on account of him acting faithlessly [note: his treachery]\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con., dgb\f* with her.
\v 9 And if he appoints her to his son, according to the judgment/procedure of daughters he must deal with her.
\v 10 If he takes another to himself, her food, her clothing, and her cohabitation\f + \ft marital intercourse\f* he must not diminish\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, urg\f* .
\v 11 And if he does not do these three things for her then he must let her go out for nothing without money.
