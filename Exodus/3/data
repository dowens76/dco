\v 2 And an angel of the Lord appeared\f + \ft 3, M, S, Ni., Imp., VC\f* to him in a flame of fire in the midst of the thorny bush and he saw\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* and behold the bush was burning\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* in the fire and the thorny bush was not consumed\f + \ft ???\f* .

\v 4 And the Lord saw\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* that he had turned aside\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* to see\f + \ft Q, IC\f* and God called\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to him from the midst of the bush and he said, "Moses, Moses."

\p
\v 5 And he said, "Do not draw near\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* here. Slip off\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* your sandals from upon your feet because the place where you are standing\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f*\f + \ft upon\f* is holy ground."

\v 7 And the Lord said, "I have surely\f + \ft Q, IA\f* seen\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* the poverty of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* their cries from before his oppressors because I have known\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* his\f + \ft their\f* pain.
\v 8 And I shall descend\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to deliver\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* him from the hand of Egypt and to bring him up\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* from that land to a good and spacious land to the land flowing\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* with milk and honey to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perrizites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.
\v 9 And now behold the cry of the children of Israel has come to me and even I have seen\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* the oppression which Egypt is oppressing\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* them.
\v 10 And now go\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* and I shall send you\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp., Vconj.\f* to Pharaoh and bring out\f + \ft M, S, Hi., Impv.\f* my people, the children of Israel, from Egypt."
\p
\v 11 And Moses siad to God, "Who am I that I should go\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp.\f* to Pharaoh and that I should bring out\f + \ft 1, C, S, Hi., Imp.\f* the children of Israel from Egypt?"
\p
\v 12 And he said, "Because I shall be\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp.\f* with you and this is the sign for you that I have sent you\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* , when you shall bring the people out\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* from Egypt you shall serve\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* God on this mountain."
\p
\v 13 And Moses said to God, "Behold if I come\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* to the children of Israel and I shall say\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per., VC\f* to them 'The God of your fathers has sent me\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* to you,' then when they shall say\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* to me, 'What is his name?' what shall I say\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp.\f* to them?'
\p
\v 14 And God said to Moses, "I am who I am." And he siad, "Thus you shall say\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* to the children of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
\v 15 And God said to Moses again, "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, 'The Lord the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob has sent me to you,' this shall be my name forever and this shall be my remembrence from generation to generation."
\p
\v 16 Go\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* and gather\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* the elders of Israel and say\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* to them, 'The Lord the God of your fathers has appeared\f + \ft 3, M, S, Ni., Per.\f* to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saying, 'I have surely payed attention to them and the things being done\f + \ft M, S, Q, Passpart.\f* to them in Egypt.
\v 17 and I have said\f + \ft 1, C, A, Q, Imp., VC\f* I shall bring them up\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp.\f* out of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizites and the Hivites and the Jebusites to a land flowing\f + \ft F, S, Q, Part.\f* with milk and honey.'
\v 18 And they shall obey\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, per., VC\f* you and you and the elders of Israel shall go\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* to the king of Egypt and you shall say\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* to him, 'The Lord the God of the Hebrews has been present upon us and now please let us go\f + \ft 1, C, S, Ni., Per.\f* a journey of three days in the wilderness and let us sacrifice\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Coh.\f* to the Lord our God.'
\v 19 And I have known\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* that the king of Egypt shall not give\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* you to go\f + \ft Q, IC\f* if not by a strong hand.
\v 20 And I shall send my hand and I shall strike\f + \ft 1, C, S, Hi., Per., VC\f* Egypt with all my wonders which I shall do in his midst and after thus he shall send\f + \ft 3, M, S, Pi., Imp.\f* you.
