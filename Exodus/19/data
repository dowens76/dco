\v 3 And Moses went up to God and the Lord called to him from the mountain saying, Ã¢ÂÂThus you will say to the house of Jacob and you will tell to the children of Israel:
\v 4 Ã¢ÂÂYou have seen what I have done to the Egyptians and that I lifted you up the wings of eagles and I brought you to myself.
\v 5 And now surely if you obey me and you keep my covenant then you will be my treasured possession above all peoples for all the earth is mine.
\v 6 And you will be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation.Ã¢ÂÂ These are the words which you will speak to the children of Israel.Ã¢ÂÂ
\p
\v 7 So Moses came and he called to the elders of the people and he set before them all these words which the Lord commanded him.
\v 8 And all the people answered together and they said, Ã¢ÂÂAll of what the Lord said we will do.Ã¢ÂÂ So Moses returned the words of the people to the Lord.
