\v 11 For the poor will not cease\f + \fr 15.11: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, חדל.\f* from the midst of the land. Therefore I command you\f + \fr 15.11: \ft Piel, Part., ms, + 2ms suffix, צוה.\f* saying,\f + \fr 15.11: \ft Qal, Inf. Con., + ל prefix, אמר.\f* "You shall surely\f + \fr 15.11: \ft Qal, Inf.

\v 12 If your brother a hebrew man or woman is sold to you, he shall serve you six years and in the seventh year you shall set him free from with you.
\v 13 And when you set him free from you you shall not send him empty-handed.
\v 14 You shall surely provide for him from your sheep and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat; with what Yhwh your God blessed you, you will give to him.
\v 15 And you will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and Yhwh your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this matter today.
\v 16 And it will be if he says to you, "I will not go out from with you," for he loves you and and your house, for it is good for him with you.
\v 17 then you shall take the awl and put it in his ear and in the door, and he will be your servant forever, and also to your female slave you shall do thus.
\v 18 It will not be hard in your eyes when you send him out free from with you, because double the reward of the hired laborer he served you six yeras and Yhwh your God will bless you in all that you do.
\p
\v 19 Every first-born male that are born in your cattle and in your sheep, you shall consecrate to Yhwh your God; you shall not work with the first-born of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstborn of your sheep.
\v 20 Before Yhwh your God you shall eat it year by year in the place where Yhwh will choose, you and your house.
\v 21 But if there is a blemish in it, it is lame or blind, any bad defect, you shall not sacrifice it to Yhwh your God.
\v 22 In your gate you shall eat it, the unclean and the clean together, as a gazelle or deer.
\v 23 Only its blood you shall not eat; you shall pour it on the ground like water.
