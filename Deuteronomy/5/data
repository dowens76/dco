\v 1 And Moses called to all Israel and he said to them, "Hear O Israel the ordinances and judgments which I am speaking in your ears this day, and you shall learn them and keep them to do them.
\v 2 Yhwh our God made a covenant with you at Horeb.
\v 3 Not with our fathers did Yhwh make this covenant only with us, we who all of us are alive today.
\v 4 Yhwh spoke with you face to face on the mountain in the midst of the fire.
\v 5 I stood between Yhwh and you at that time to tell you the word of Yhwh, for you were afraid before the fire and you did not go up on the mountain, saying,

\v 6 'I am Yhwh your God\f + \ft Verbless clause (Anderson): identification = A clause that identifies a subject as a particular/specific person, object, etc.\f* who\f + \ft GKC §138.d: "If the governing substantive forms part of a statement made in the first or second person, the retrospective pronoun (or the subject of the appositional clause) is in the same person."\f* brought you out\f + \ft Hiph., Perf., 1cs, יצא, "go out" + 2ms suffix\f* of the land of Egypt from the house of slavery.\f + \ft Notice two construct strings, both of which modify the verb. Also, עֲבָדִֽ֑ים has a silluq indicating the end of a verse and an etnach indicating the middle of the verse. GKC §15.p points out that double accentuation "is adopted simply for the purposes of public reading, in order to reduce the original twelve verses (with sublinear accentuation) to ten, the number of the Commandments." On this construct phrase, Tigay (64) suggests this might be a term for slave barracks.\f*

\v 7 You shall have\f + Qal, Impf., 3ms, היה, "to be"\f* no other gods before\f + \ft On עַל־פָּנָיַ, HALOT 944: "the exact sense is disputed. . . . possible solutions are: 1. next to me (ZürBib.; Zorell Lex. 658a; Beer HAT 3 (1939) 98); 2. except me (Gesenius-B.; cf. Pesh., Tg. and Sept. on Ex 203); 3. over me, to my disadvantage (von Rad ATD 8:39; cf. Stamm ThR 27 (1961) 237f); 4. in front of me (Nielsen Die zehn Gebote 78, and Childs Exodus 386); 5. opposite me, before my face (Noth ATD 5:122; Knierim ZAW 77 (1965) 23-27; TOB; cf. Sept. and Vulg. on Dt 57); 6. in defiance of me (KBL; Preuss BWANT 92 (1971) 18; similarly Driver in Fschr. Albright (1971) 89); NRSV: no other gods before me, margin: besides me; REB: besides me (see above 2)." Tigay chooses the sense "in addition to me" and points to a similar use of עַל in Gen 31:50 of Jacob taking other wives.\f* me.

\v 8 You shall not make\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, עשׁה, "to make, do"\f* for yourself an idol of any form which is in heaven above or which is on the earth below or which is in the sea below the earth.
\v 9 You shall not bow\f + \ft Hisht., Impf., 2ms, חוה, "to bow down"\f* to them or serve them,\f + \ft Qal or Hoph., Impf., 2ms, עבד, "to serve" + 3mp suffix; GKC §60.6 regards this as an anomalous form of the qal imperfect, but then asks, "Could the Masora in the two Decalogues and in Ex 23:24 (on the analogy of which Dt 13:3 was then wrongly pointed) have intended an imperfect Hophʿal with the suffix, meaning thou shalt not allow thyself to be brought to worship them?” The Qamets-Hatuf in the second syllable suggests this. Jouon-Muraoka 63.b suggests this form was meant "to avoid the form anticipated in pause תַּעֲבֹדֶם. The o has shifted to the beginning of the word . . . (comp. imperative קָטלֵם ,קְטֹל.”\f* for I am Yhwh your God, El Qanna',\f + \ft Block: "According to Andersen’s Rule 1, 'The sequence is S-P in a clause of identification in which both S and P are definite.' Conclusion: This clause could be interpreted either as 'For I am Yahweh your God, El Qanna’,' or, though less likely, 'For I am Yahweh your God, a jealous God.' The use of the expression elsewhere may determine which is preferred."\f* punishing\f + \ft Qal, Part., mp, פקד, "to inspect, instruct, call to account"\f* the sin of the fathers on the children and on the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,\f + \ft Qal, Part., MP, const., שָׂנֵא, "to hate" + 1cs suffix\f*
\v 10 and doing\f + \ft Qal, part., ms, absolute, עשׂה, "to do" + waw conj.\f* acts of loyalty to thousands of those who love me\f + \ft Qal, part., mp, const., אהב, "to love," + ל prep, 1cs suffix\f* and who keep\f + \ft Qal, Part., mp, const., שׁמר, "to keep" + waw conj., ל prep.\f* my commands.\f + \ft \it Qere. Ketiv: "his commands."\it* Could be explained as a confusion of yod and waw, though the Ketiv is certainly the more difficult reading.\f*
\p
\v 11 You shall not bear\f + \ft Qal, impf., 2ms, נשׂא, "to lift, carry"\f* the name of Yhwh your God worthlessly,\f + \ft For this translation of לַשָׁוְא, see Block, How I Love your Torah, O LORD!, 66.\f* for Yhwh will not leave unpunished\f + \ft Piel, Impf., 3ms, נקה, Niphal: "be free, exempt, innocent" Piel: "leave unpunished." Though this is doubly weak, the form is regular except for the vowel under the second radical, which is seghol due to the he as the third radical. So it follows the III he form exactly.\f* the one who bears\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, נשׂא, "to lift, bear." I translate the imperfect with a gnomic sense, but it could be a future sense.\f* his name worthlessly.
\p
\v 12 Keep\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Abs., שׁמר, "to keep." Infinitive acts as a command and begins the sentence (Waltke-O'Connor §35.5.1.a).\f* the Sabbath day to make it holy\f + \ft Piel, Inf. Con., קדשׁ, "to be holy" Piel: "to consecrate" + ל prep., 3ms suffix. Waltke-O'Connor §36.2.3.e: "As a gerundive, explanatory or epexegetical, the construction ל + infinitive often explains the circumstances or nature of a preceding action."\f* as Yhwh your God commanded you.\f + \ft Piel, perf., 3ms, צוה, "to command" + 2ms suffix\f*
\v 13 Six days\f + \ft Gibson §36.a: "With יָמִים days the cons. is usual."\f* you shall work\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, עבד, "to serve, work"\f* and do\f + \ft Qal., Perf., 2ms, עשׂה, "to do," + waw cons.\f* all your work,
\v 14 but\f + \ft Begins with a disjunctive waw.\f* the seventh day\f + \ft Waltke-O'Connor §15.3.2.b: "If the day alone is mentioned, there are two common formulas. The first is used for the ordinals ‘first-tenth’ and involves יוֹם with the article, followed by the ordinal with the article."\f* is a Sabbath to Yhwh your God; you shall not do\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, עשׂה, "to do"\f* any work, neither you nor\f + \ft Gibson §152: "The conj. and often expresses our or, nor, e.g. after a neg., the neg. denying the whole combination of words."\f* your sons nor your daughters nor your male servants nor your female servants nor your ox nor your donkey nor any of your cattle nor your sojourners who are in your gates so that your male servant and your maidservant may rest\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, נוח, "to rest." This is a modal use of the imperfect, perhaps what Waltke-O'Connor §31.4.d–e calls the non-perfective of possibility or permission.\f* like you.
\v 15 And you shall remember\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, זכר, "to remember" + waw cons.\f* that you were\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 2ms, היה, "to be"\f* a servant in the land of Egypt and Yhwh your God brought you out\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms, יצא, "to go out," + waw cons., 2ms suffix\f* from there with a strong hand and an outstretched\f + \ft Qal, Pass.

\p
\v 17 You shall not murder.\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, רצח, "to kill." HALOT 1283: "[T]he verb, with the exception of Nu 35:30, denotes illegal behaviour against the community which is always directed against an individual," i.e., murder.\f*

\v 19 And you shall not steal.\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, גנב, "to steal"\f*

\p
\v 21 And you shall not desire\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, חמד, "to desire, crave." Note also the samekh in the middle of the verse.\f* the wife of your neighbor.
\p And you shall not long\f + \ft Hith., Impf.., 2ms, אוה, Qal: "to be beautiful, lovely" Hith.: "to crave, long for." Tigay (72) understands the conjugation to mean "continuous or repeated action."\f* for the house of your neighbor, his field, or his servant or his maidservant, his ox or his donkey or anything which is your neighbor's.

\v 22 Yhwh spoke these words to your whole assembly on the mountain in the midst of the fire, the cloud and the thick darkness, a great voice and he did not add. And he wrote them on two tablets of stone and he gave them to me.
\v 23 And when you heard the voice from the mdist of the darkness and the mountain was burning with fire and you drew near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders.
\v 24 And you said, "Behold, Yhwh our God has made us see his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice from the midst of the fire this day we have seen God speak to a man and he lives.
\v 25 And now why should we die? For this great fire will consume us. If we again hear the voice of Yhwh our God then we will die.
\v 26 For who of all flesh who has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire like us and live?
\v 27 Draw near, you, and hear all which Yhwh our God will speak and you speak to us all which Yhwh our God will speak to you and we will hear and do it."
\p
\v 28 And Yhwh heard the voice of your words when you spoke to me and Yhwh said to hme, "I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They do well in all that they have spoken.
\v 29 Who will give and their heart will be this for them to fear me and to keep all my commands all their days so that it may go well for them and for their children forever.
\v 30 Go, say to them, 'Return to your tents.'
\v 31 But you, stand here with me and I will speak to you every command and statute and judgment which you shall learn and they will do in the land which I am giving to them to take possession of."
\v 32 And you shall keep to do just as Yhwh your God commanded you, you shall not turn aside to the right or the left.
\v 33 In every way which Yhwh your God has commanded you, you shall go so that you may live and it go well for you and you live long in the land which you will possess.
