\v 1 And this is the command, the statutes, and the judgments that Yhwh your God commanded to teach you to do in the land that you are crossing over to possess,
\v 2 in order that you may fear Yhwh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commands that I am commanding you, you and your children and your children's children, all the days of your life and in order that your days may be lengthened.
\v 3 And you will hear, O Israel, and keep to do that it will be good for you and that you may be exceedingly numerous, just as Yhwh the God of your fathers spoke to you, [in]\f + \ft There is no preposition here, and the phrase seems just to be appended to the end of the sentence, but it likely refers to things going well in the land. See GKC §118.a, in which accusatives may specify the immediate circumstance of the anction, though §118.g notes that LXX suggests that a verb for giving was dropped. It seems more likely that LXX is smoothing over the awkward grammatical construction.\f* a land flowing with\f + \ft Waltke-O'Connor 9.5.2.d notes this as an adverbial use of the genitive, best represented with the preposition "with."+ \ft Waltke-O'Connor 9.5.2.d notes this as an adverbial use of the genitive, best represented with the preposition "with."\f* milk and honey.

\v 4 Hear,\f + \ft Qal, Impv., ms, שׁמע, "to hear." Block, Deuteronomy, 321, "it accords the oral rhetorical style of the book as a whole." Cf. Deut 4:1; 5:1; 9:1; 27:9. "The construction of the remainder is without parallel in the entire Old Testament, so any interpretation, including our own, should be deemed provisional."\f* O Israel, YHWH is our God, YHWH alone.\f + \ft Note the verbless clause. Waltke-O'Connor 15.2.1.b suggests that אֶחָד is a predicate adjective here meaning "integral (i.e., having integrity)." Waltke-O'Connor 8.4.2.g, of the four words after "Israel": "However they are construed, it is agreed that no closely comparable passage occurs. The simplest solution is to recognize two juxtaposed verbless clauses: (a) יהוה אֱלֹהֵ֫ינוּ “YHWH is our God’ (identifying clause, S-Pred); (b) יהוה אֶחָד ‘YHWH is one’ (classifying clause, S-Pred, with a numeral; cf. # 23). Few scholars favor such a parsing. Andersen takes…יהוה יהוה as a discontinuous predicate, with the other two words as a discontinuous subject, ‘Our one God is YHWH, YHWH’ (Anderson, Hebrew Verbless Clause, 47). Other proposed parsings take the first two words as subject (viz., ‘YHWH our God is one YHWH’) or the first three words (viz., ‘YHWH, our God, YHWH is one’) or even the first word alone. It is hard to say if אחד can serve as an adjective modifying יהוה. It is even less clear what the predicate אלהינו יהוה אחד would mean, though some scholars take it adverbially (‘YHWH is our God, YHWH alone’). As Gerald Janzen observes, “the Shema does not conform exactly to any standard nominal sentence pattern,” and further discussion falls outside the sphere of grammar (Though not beyond it. Cf. Janzen, “Shema,” 296.)."***READ BLOCK'S ARTICLE*** The last letters of the first and last words are extra large (literae majusculae) in the Leningrad Codex, spelling עד, which could mean "witness" (Holladay, 265) or "continuing future, always" (Holladay, 264). A number of views have been expressed about the significance of this. (1) Van der Merwe et al §9.8.3.1 suggest this is to call attention to the passage. (2) I. Yeivin, Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah, trans. and ed. E. J. Revell (Masoretic Studies 5; Missoula: Scholars Press, 1980), 48, suggests that they warn the reader to be precise. (3) Tigay, Deuteronomy, 441, suggests that the Shema' is a witness to the unity of Yahweh or a witness against Israel; Block, Deuteronomy, 320, suggests that in that case "it functions like the Song of Moses in 31:19–21. Cf. Ps 50:7, 'Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel I will testify against you; I am God your God.'" In any case, this reading tradition affirms that the text is important for Judaism. \f*

\v 10 And when Yhwh your God brings you into the land which he swore to your fathers and to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to you great and good cities and which you did not build
\v 11 and houses filled with all good that you did not fill and hewn cisterns that you did not hew out, vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant, and you will eat and be satisfied,
\v 12 then watch yourself lest you forget Yhwh who brought you out from the land of Egypt from the house of slavery.
\v 13 You shall fear Yhwh your God and you shall serve him and by his name you shall swear.
\v 14 You shall not go after other gods from the peoples who surround you.
\v 15 For Yhwh your God in your midst is a jealous God, lest the anger of Yhwh become hot against you and he destroy you from on the face of the ground.
\p
\v 16 You shall not put Yhwh your God to the test as you tested at Massah.
\v 17 You shall surely keep the commands of Yhwh your God and his testimonies and his statutes that he commanded you.
\v 18 And you shall do what is upright and good in the eyes of Yhwh so that it may go well for you and you may come and take possession of the good land that Yhwh swore to your fathers
\v 19 to thrust away all your enemies from before you as Yhwh spoke.

\v 20 When your son asks you in the future saying, "What are the testimonies and statues and judgments that Yhwh our God commanded you?"
\v 21 Then you will say to your son, "We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt and Yhwh brought us out from Egypt by a mighty hand.
\v 22 And Yhwh gave signs and wonders, great and awful, in Egypt against Pharaoh and against all his house before our eyes.
\v 23 And he brought us out from there to bring us to give us the land that he swore to our fathers.
\v 24 And Yhwh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yhwh our God, for our good all the days to preserve life, as this day.
\v 25 And it will be righteousness for us, if we are careful to do all this command before Yhwh our God as he commanded us.
