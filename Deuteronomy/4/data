\v 4 But you faithful ones to YHWH your God are alive, all of you, this day.
\v 5 See\f + \ft Qal, Impv. ms, \ft ראה\ft "see"\f* I have taught\f + \ft Piel, Perf., 1cs, \ft למד\ft "Piel: teach"\f* you the statutes and the judgments as YHWH my God commanded\f + \ft Piel, Perf., 3ms, \ft צוה\ft "command" + 1cs suffix\f* me to do\f + \ft Qal, Inf.

\v 6 And you shall keep\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 2mp, \ft שׁמר\ft "keep" + waw cons.\f* and do\f + \ft \fm q\fm* Qal, Perf., 2mp, עשׂה, "do" + waw cons.\f* them, for it will be your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples who hear\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3mp, \ft שׁמע\ft "hear" + paragogic nun\f* all these statutes and they say,\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 3cp, \ft אמר\ft "say" + waw cons.\f* 'Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
\v 7 For what great nation is there whose god is near to them like YHWH our God whenever we call\f + \ft Qal, Inf Con., \ft קרא\ft "call" + 1cp suffix\f* on him.
\v 8 And what great nation is there whose statutes and judgments are righteous like all this instruction which I am giving\f + \ft Qal, Part., ms, \ft נתן\ft "give"\f* before you today.
\v 9 Only watch\f + \ft Niphal, Impv., ms, \ft שׁמר\ft "keep, watch."\f* yourself and watch\f + \ft Qal, Impv., ms, \ft שׁמר\ft "keep, watch."\f* your soul carefully lest you forget\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2ms, \ft שׁכח\ft "forget."\f* the things that your eyes have seen\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 3cp, \ft ראה\ft "see."\f* and lest they turn aside\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3mp, \ft סור\ft "turn aside, depart."\f* from your heart all the days of your life; And you shall make them known\f + \ft Ηiph., Perf., 2mp, \ft ידע\ft "know."\f* to your children and to your children's children.
\v 10 The day when you stood\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 2ms, \ft עמד\ft "stand"\f* before YHWH your God at Horeb when YHWH said\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Cons., \ft אמר\ft "say" + \ft ב\ft prep.\f* to me, 'Gather\f + \ft Hiph., Impv., ms, \ft קהל\ft "gather"\f* to me the people and I will cause them to hear\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., 1cs, \ft שׁמע\ft "hear" + 3mp suffix\f* my words so that they will learn\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3mp, \ft למד\ft "learn"\f* to fear\f + \ft Qal, Inf.

\v 11 And you came near and stood under the mountain. Now\f + \ft Circumstantial clause (disjunctive waw).\f* the mountain was burning with fire up to the heart of heaven, with\f + \ft Adverbial accusative.\f* darkness, clouds and thick darkness.
\v 12 And YHWH spoke to you from the midst of the fire. A sound of words you heard and there was no form for you to see, only a voice.
\v 13 And he declared to you his covenant, that is he commanded you to do the ten words,\f + \ft For a justification of this translation, see Jerry Hwang's dissertation.\f* and he wrote them on two tablets of stone.
\v 14 And YHWH commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments for you to do them in the land where you are crossing over there to possess.
\p
\v 15 And watch yourselves carefully, since you did not see any form on the day YHWH spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire
\v 16 lest you behave corruptly and make for yourself an image of a form of any sculpture in the pattern of man or woman,
\v 17 the pattern of any animal which is on the earth, the pattern of any bird with wings which flies in the sky,
\v 18 the pattern of any thing that creeps on the ground, the pattern of any fish that is in the sea under the earth
\v 19 And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars of all the host of heaven and you be led astray and you bow down to them and you serve them which YHWH your God has apportioned to all the peoples under heaven.
\v 20 But YHWH took you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt to be for him a people, an inheritance, as this day.
\v 21 And YHWH was angry with me because of your words and he swore I would not cross over the Jordan and go into the good land which YHWH your God is giving to you as an inheritance.
\v 22 For I will die in this land, I cannot cross over the Jordan, but you will cross over and take possession of this good land.
\v 23 Watch yourselves lest you forget the covenant of YHWH your God which he made with you and lest you make an idol for yourself in the form of anything which YHWH your God commanded you.
\v 24 For YHWH your God is a consuming fire, he is a jealous God.
\p
\v 25 When you father children and children of children\f + \fp or grandchildren\f* and you are old in the land and you act corruptly\f + \fp Hiph., Perf., 2mp, שׁחת, destroy, "act corruptly"\f* and you make an idol in the form of anything and you do evil in the eyes of YHWH your God to anger him,
\v 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you today that you will surely perish quickly from the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You wil not be days in it for you will be completely destroyed.
\v 27 And YHWH will disperse you among the peoples and few men you will remain among the nations where YHWH will drive you.
\v 28 And there you will serve gods that are the work of human hands made of wood and stone which do not see and do not hear and do not eat and do not smell.
\v 29 And you will seek from there YHWH your God and you wil find him when you seek him with all of your heart and with all of your person.
\v 30 In your anxiety and all these things find you in the later days then you will return to YHWH your God and you will listen to his voice.
\v 31 For YHWH your God is a merciful God, he will not desert you and he will not destroy you\f + \fp Cf. v. 25 and use of שׁחת.\f* and he will not forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.
\p
\v 32 For ask now about the former days which were before you, about from the day when God created man on the earth and about from one end of the heavens as far as the other end of the heavens; was there been anything like this great thing, or was anything like it been heard?
\v 33 Has a people heard to the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire as you heard and lived?
\v 34 Or has God dared\f + \ft Block: this is a challenge to the gods.\f* to come to take for himself a nation from within a nation with daring acts,\f + \ft Block: cognate noun with the verb נסה earlier in the verse.\f* with signs, and with wonders and with war and by a strong hand and an outstretched arm and with great terrors like all which YHWH your God has done for you in Egypt before your eyes.
\v 35 You were shown to know that YHWH is God and there is no further besides him.
\v 36 From the heavens he made you hear his voice to instruct you and on the earth he made you see his great fire and you heard his words from the midst of the fire.
\v 37 And because he loved your fathers and chose his seed after him, he brought you out personally\f + \ft Lit., "with his face." Block: this phrase should be translated "personally."\f* by his great strength from Egypt
\v 38 to drive out nations greater and mightier than you from before you to bring you in to give to you their land as an inheritance as at this day.\f + \ft Block: Here Moses emphasizes, "We're there!" But the sad thing is Moses won't be there.\f*
\v 39 And you will know the day and (when?) you will return to your heart that YHWH is God in heaven above and on the earth below, there is no other.
\v 40 And you have heard his statutes and his commands which I have commanded you today which will be good for you and for your children after you that you may lengthen days on the ground which YHWH your God is giving to you all days."
\p
\v 41 Then Moses singled out three cities beyond the Jordan in the east
\v 42 to flee there for the murderer who murders his neighbor without knowledge and he does not hate him in the past, and he will flee to one of these cities and live.
\v 43 Bezer in the desert in the land of the plain for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
\p
\v 44 And this is the instruction that Moses placed before the children of Israel.
\v 45 These are the testimonies and the ordinances and judgments which Moses spoke to the children of Israel when they went out of Egypt.
\v 46 Beyond the Jordan in the valley opposite Beth Peor in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon which Moses and the children of Israel struck when they went out of Egypt.
\v 47 And they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites who are beyond the Jordan in the east.
\v 48 From Aroer which is on the edge of the valley of Arnon as far as Mount Sirion which is Hermon.
\v 49 And all the Arabah beyond the Jordan to the east and as far as the sea of the Arabah under the slopes of Pisgah.
