\v 9 And I said to you at that time, saying, "I am not able to bear you alone.
\v 10 Yhwh your God has multiplied you, and look at you today, you are numerous as the stars of the sky.
\v 11 May Yhwh the God of your fathers add to you like you a thousand times and may he bless you as he spoke to you.
\v 12 How shall I alone bear your burden and your load and your dispute?
\v 13 Get for yourselves men who are wise, understanding, and known to your tribes and set them as your leaders."
\v 14 And you answered me and you said, "The word that you ahve spoken is good to do."
\v 15 So I took leaders of your tribes, men who were wise and known, and I set them as leaders over you, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, leaders of tens, and officials for your tribes.
\v 16 And I commanded your judges at that time, saying, "Listen to your brothers and judge righteousness between a man and his brother and between his alien.
\v 17 You shall not recognize faces in judgment; whether small or great you shall listen, you shall not be afraid of the face of man for judgment belongs to God and the matter that is too hard for you you shall bring to me and I will hear it."
\v 18 And I commanded you at that time all the words which you shall do.
\p
\v 19 And we departed from Horeb and came to all that great and fearful desert which you saw, the way of the hill country of the Amorites, just as Yhwh our God commanded us, and we came to Kadesh Barnea.
\v 20 And I said to you, "You have come to the hilll country of the Amorites which Yhwh our God is giving to us.
\v 21 See, Yhwh your God has given the land before you; go up, take possession as Yhwh the God of your Fathers spoke to you; do not be afraid and do not be terrified."
\p
\v 22 All of you came to me and you said, "Let us send men before us and let them search for us the land and let them return to us word concerning the way which we should go up and the cities which we will come to."
\v 23 And the plan was good to me and I took from you twelve men, one for each tribe.
\v 24 And they turned and went up to the hill country and they came to the Valey of Eschol and they spied it out.
\v 25 And they took in their hand from the fruit of the land and they brought it down to us and they returned to us a report and they said, 'The land is good which Yhwh our God is giving us."
\p
\v 26 But you were not willing to go up and you rebelled against the face of Yhwh your God.
\v 27 And you slandered us among your tents and you said, "Because Yhwh hates us he brought us out of Egypt to give us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us.
\v 28 Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, 'The people are greater and higher than us; The cities are great and unassailable in the heavens, and also we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"
\v 29 I said to you, "You shall not be in dread and you shall not be afraid of them.
\v 30 Yhwh your God is the one who walks before you; he will fight for you according to all which he has done with you in Egypt for your eyes.
\v 31 An din the desert when you saw how Yhwh your God lifted you up as a man lifts his son in all the way which you have gone until you came to this place.
\v 32 And in this matter no one of you trusted in Yhwh your God.
\v 33 He is the one who walks before you in the way to spy out for you a place for you to settle with fire by night for you to see the way which you are going and with cloud by day."
\p
\v 34 And Yhwh heard the voice of your words and he was angry and swore saying,
\v 35 "No man among these men of this evil generation will see the good land which I have sworn to give to your fathers.
\v 36 Except for Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it and to him I will give the land in which he tread, and to his sons because he was fully after God."
\v 37 Also with me Yhwh was angry because of you saying, "Also you will not go there."
\v 38 Joshua son of Nun who stands before you will go there. Encourage him, for he will make Israel inherit.
\v 39 And your little children whom you have said would be spoil and your sons who have not known today good and eveil, they will come there and to them I will give it and they will take possession of it.
\v 40 And you, turn aside and journey to the desert by the way of the see of reeds."
\p
\v 41 And you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against Yhwh; let us go up and fight according to all which Yhwh our God has commanded." And each man of you girded himself with his weapons of war and you thought it easy to go up to the hill country.
\v 42 And Yhwh said to me, "Say to them, 'You shall not go up and you shall not fight, for I am not in your midst and you will not be struck before your enemies.'"
\v 43 And I spoke to you and you did not listen and you rebelled agains the face of Yhwh and you were insolent and went up to the hill country.
\v 44 And the Amorites dwelling in that hill country came out to meet you and they pursued you as bees do, and they beat you in Seir as far as Hormah.
\v 45 And you returned and you wept before Yhwh and Yhwh did not listen to your voice and he did not listen to you.
\v 46 And you dwelt in Kadesh many days as the days which you dwelt.
