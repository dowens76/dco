\c 14
\p
\v 1 You are children of YHWH your God; you shall not cut yourselves, nor shall you place a bald patch between your eyes for the dead.
\v 2 For you are a people holy to YHWH your God and you YHWH has chosen to to be for him a people, a treasured possession from all the peoples that are on the face of the ground.
\p
\v 3 You shall not eat any abomination.
\v 4 These are the animals that you may eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
\v 5 the deer, the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wildgoat, and the aurochs, and the antelope, and the gazelle,
\v 6 and all the animals that divide the hoof and have the hoof cleft in two, that bring up the cud among the animals you shall eat.
\v 7 Only these you shall not eat from those that bring up the cud and divide the hoof cleft, the camel, the hare, and the rock badger, for they bring up the cud but the hoof they do not divide---they are unclean for you.
\v 8 And the pig, because it divides the hoof but not the cud, it is unclean for you. From their meat you shall not eat, and their carcass you shall not touch.
\p
\v 9 This you may eat from all that is in the water: everything that has fins and scles you may eat.
\v 10 But everything that does not have fins and scaes you may not eat---it is unclean for you.
\p
\v 11 Every clean bird you may eat.
\v 12 And this is what you shall not eat from them: the eagle, and the vulture, and the black vulture,
\v 13 and the red kite, and the black kite, and the bird of prey from it's [kind?],
\v 14 and every raven by its kind,
\v 15 and the ostrich, the owl, the seagull by its kind,
\v 16 the small owl, and the great owl, and the water hen,
\v 17 \f + \ft From here to the end of the list of birds, NRSV.\f*and the desert owl, and the carrion vulture and the cormorant,
\v 18 the stork, the herony of any kind; the hoopoe and the bat.
\v 19 And all winged-swarming insects are unclean for you---you shall not eat.
\v 20 All clean winged creatures you may eat.
\p
\v 21 You shall not eat any carcass. To the sojourner who is in your gates you may give it and he may eat it or sell it to a foreigner, for you are a people holy to YHWH your God.
\p You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk.
\p
\v 22 You shall surely tithe all the produce of your seed that comes out of the field year by year.
\v 23 And you shall eat before YHWH your God in the place where he will choose for his name to dwell the tithe of your grain and your wine and your olive oil and the firstborn of your cattle and your sheep so that you may learn to fear YHWH your God all your days.
\v 24 But if the way is too far for you, for you are not able to bear it for the place where YHWH your God will choose to place his name there will be far from you when YHWH your God will bless you,
\v 25 then you shall give it in silver and you shall clasp the silver in your hand and you shall go to the place that YHWH your God will chose
\v 26 And you shall give the silver for anything that your soul wants in cattle or in sheep or in wine or in anything that your soul desires, and you shall eat there before YHWH your God and you shall rejoice, you and your household.
\v 27 And the levite that is in your gate you shall not abandon, for he has no share of property or patrimony with you.
\p
\v 28 At the end of three yeras you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce in that year and you shall deposit it in your gate.
\v 29 And the levite will come, for he has no share of property or patrimony with you, and the sojourner and the orphan and the widow who are in your gates, and they will eat and be satisfied in order that YHWH your God may bless you in every the deed of your hand that you may do.
