\v 1 Keep the month of Abib and make the passover to YHWH your God, for in the month of Abib YHWH your God brought you out of Egypt by night.
\v 2 And you shall slaughter the passover sacrifice to YHWH your God, sheep and cattle in the place where YHWh will choose for his name to dwell.
\v 3 You shall not eat with it something leavened. Seven days you shall eat with it unleavened bread of affliction, for in haste you went ou to f the land of Egypt so that you might rememebr the day of your going out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
\v 4 And leaven shall not be seen with youin all your territory seven days, and there shall not remain from the meat that you slaughter in th eevening on the first day to the morning.
\v 5 You are not able to slaughter the passover sacrifice on the first day in on eof your gates that YHWH your God is giving you.
\v 6 Only to the place that YHWH your God will choose for his name to dwell you shall slaughter the sacrifice in the evening as the sun goes at the appointed time as your going out of Egypt.
\v 7 And you shall cook and eat in the place that YHWH your God will choose, and you may turn in the morning and go to your tents.
\v 8 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day a festive assembly to YHWh your God, you shall do no work.
