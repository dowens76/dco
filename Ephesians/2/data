\v 1 And although you were (Pr., A, Part., M, P, N) dead in your transgressions and sins,
\v 2 in which you formerly walked (A, A, Ind., 2, P) according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit which is now at work (Pr., A, Part., M, S, G) in the sons of disobedience,
\v 3 among whom also we all formerly lived (A, P, Ind., 1, P, anastrefw) in the lusts of our flesh by living out (Pr., A, Part., M, P, N) the desires of the flesh and of our minds, and we were (Imp., Ind., 1, P) by nature children of wrath as also the rest are;
\v 4 but because God is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved (A, A, Ind., 3, S) us,
\v 5 although we were (Pr., A, Part., M, P, N) dead in our transgressions, he made (us) alive together with Christ, —by grace you are (Pr., Ind., 2, P) saved (Per., A, Part., M, P, N)—
\v 6 and He raised with (A, A, Ind., 3, S) and He seated us (A, A, Ind., 3, S) with Christ Jesus in the heavenly world,
\v 7 in order that he might show (A, M, S, 3, S, endeiknumi) in the coming (Pr., D, Part., M, P, D) ages the surpassing riches of his grace in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
\v 8 For by grace you are (Pr., Ind., 2, P) saved (Per., P, Part., M, P, N) through faith; and this is not from you, it is the gift of God;
\v 9 it is not from works, in order that no one should boast (A, D, S, 3, S).
\v 10 For we are His created thing, because you were created (A, P, Part., M, P, N) in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand (A, A, Ind., 3, S), in order that in them we should walk (A, A, S, 1, P).
