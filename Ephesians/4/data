\v 7 But the grace was given (A, P, Ind., 3, S) in every one of us according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
\v 8 Therefore it is saying: "After ascending (A, A, Part., M, S, N) into the height he captured (A, A, Ind., 3, S) captives, He gave (A, A, Ind., 3, S) gifts to the men."
\v 9 But why is (Pr., Ind., 3, S) the thing ascend (A, A, Ind., 3, S), if not because also he descended (A, A, Ind., 3, S) into the lower part of the earth?
\v 10 The one who ascended (A, A, Part., M, S, N) Himself is also the one who ascended (A, A, Part., M, S, N) far above all of the heavens, in order that all things might be fulfilled (A, A, S, 3, S).
\v 11 And He gave (A, A, Ind., 3, S) the apostles on the one hand, and the prophets, and the evangelists, and the pastors and the teachers,
\v 12 to the training of the saints into work of ministry, into the upbuilding of the body of Christ,
\v 13 until we all shall reach (F, A, Ind., 1, P) into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, into a complete man, into the measure of maturity of the fullness of Christ,
\v 14 in order that we might no longer be (Pr., S, 1, P) babes, to be tossed by the sea (Pr., P, Part., M, P, N) and to be blown about (Pr., P, Part., M, P, N) by every wind of teaching by the trickery of men, by craftiness to the trickery of deception,
\v 15 but by speaking the truth (Pr., A, Part., M, P, N) in love that we might grow (A, A, S, 1, P) into Him (into) all things, who is (Pr., Ind., 3, S) the head, Christ,
\v 16 from whom all the body is being joined together (Pr., P, Part., N, S, A) and being united (Pr., P, Part., N, S, A) through every ligament of support according to the working in measure of one each of the parts He is making (Pr., M, Ind., 3, S) the growth of the body into upbuilding of Himself with love.
