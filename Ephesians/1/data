\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus and faithful ones in Christ Jesus,
\v 2 grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the one who blessed us with every spiritual blessing in heaven in Christ,
\v 4 even as he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless before Him. In love
\v 5 he predestined us for adoption into him though Jesus Christ according to the pleasure of His will,
\v 6 so that we would praise the glory of his grace, which he gave freely to us in the Beloved One.
\v 7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, according to the riches of his grace
\v 8 which he caused to abound to us, with all wisdom and insight,
\v 9 by making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his pleasure, which he planned in him
\v 10 to accomplish his plan at the right time, to unite all things in Christ, the ones who are in the heavens and the ones who are on the earth in him.
\v 11 In him also we were chosen by being predestined according to the plan of the One who is at work in all things according to the intention of his will
\v 12 so that we would praise his glory, we who are the first to hope in Christ.
\v 13 In him also you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in him also by believing you were sealed by the Holy Spirit of the promise,
\v 14 who is a pledge of our redemption of the possession so that we would praise his glory.
\v 15 Because of this also after I heard (A, A, Part., M, S, N) of the faith with respect to you in the Lord Jesus and of the love toward all the saints
\v 16 I did not cease (Pr., M, Ind., 1, S) to give thanks (Pr., A, Inf.) on behalf of you by making (Pr., M, Part., M, S, N) remembrance on the occasion of my prayers,
\v 17 in order that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, might give (A, A, S, 3, S) to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation with knowledge of Him,
\v 18 by the eyes of your heart being illumined (Per., P, Part., M, P, A) in order that you might know (Per., A, Inf.) what is (Pr., Ind., 3, S) the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His promise in the Saints,
\v 19 and what is the surpassing (Pr., A, Part., N, S, A) greatness of his power into us the ones who are believing (Pr., A, Part., M, P, A) according to the working (supernatural) of the power of His strength
\v 20 which He accomplished (A, A, Ind., 3, S) in Christ by raising (A, A, Part., M, S, N) Him from the dead and setting (Him) (A, A, Part., M, S, N) at His right hand in the heavenly world
\v 21 far above every ruler and authority and power and angelic power and every name which is being named (Pr., A, Part., M, S, G), not only in this age but also in the one which is about to happen (Pr., A, Part., M, S, D);
\v 22 and "He put all things in subjection (A, A, Ind., 3, S) under His feet (Psalm 8:7)," and He gave (A, A, Ind., 3, S) Him to be head over all in the Church,
\v 23 whoever is (Pr., Ind., 3, S) His body, the fullness of the one who fulfills (Pr., A, Part., M, S, G) all in all.
