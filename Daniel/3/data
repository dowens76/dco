\v 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made\f + \ft Peal, Perfect, 3ms.\f* a statue (which was) gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its width was six cubits. He set it up\f + \ft Aphel, Perf., 3ms.\f* on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
\v 2 And Nebuchadnezzer the king sent to assemble\f + \ft Peal, Inf. Const.\f* the satraps, prefects and governors, counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the high officials of the provinces to come\f + \ft Peal, Inf. Const. of \ft אֲתָה\ft .\f* for the dedication of the statue which Nebuchanezzar the king had set up.
\v 3 Then the satraps, the prefects, and the governors, the counselors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the high officials of the provinces assembled\f + \ft Hithpaal, part, mp of \ft כּנשׁ\ft .\f* for the dedication of the statue which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood\f + \ft Peal, Part, mp.\f* before the statue which Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
\v 4 And the herald shouted\f + \ft Peal, Part, ms.\f* with strength, "To you it is commanded,\f + \ft Peal Part., mp.\f* 'O peoples--nations and languages
\v 5 at the time when you hear\f + \ft Peal, Impf., 2mp.\f* the sound of the horn, the pipe, the lyre, the lute, the harp, the drum, and all kinds of music, you will fall\f + \ft Peal, Impf., 2mp.\f* and pay homage to the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.\f + \ft Haphel, Perf., 3ms.\f*
\v 6 But whoever does not fall\f + \ft Peal, Impf. 3ms.\f* and pay homage,\f + \ft Peal, Impf. 3ms.\f* in that moment he will be thrown\f + \ft Hitpeel, Impf., 3ms of \ft רמה\ft .\f* into the furnace of burning\f + \ft Peal, Part., fs of \ft יקד\ft .\f* fire. ***
\v 7 Therefore at that time as all the peoples heard\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, lute, harp, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell and paid homage to the golden statue which Nebuchanezzar the king had set up.
\v 8 Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans approached and slandered the Jews.
\v 9 They answered\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, "O king, live forever.
\v 10 You, O king, set a decree that everone who hears the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, lute, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music shall fall and pay homage to the golden statue.
\v 11 And whoever does not fall and pay homage will be thrown into the furnace of burning\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* fire.
\v 12 There are certain Jews whom you appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men did not set for you, O King, a decree\f + \ft pay attention to?\f* for your gods they do not worship and to the golden image which you have set up they do not pay homage."
\v 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in rage and anger commanded to bring\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then these men were brought\f + \ft Hephal, Perf.\f* before the king.
\v 14 Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that my gods you do not serve or pay homage to the golden image which I set up?
\v 15 Now if you are ready, at the time when you year the sound of the horn, pipe, lyre, lute, harp, and drum and all kinds of music, you shall fall down and pay homage to the statue which I have made, all is well\f + \ft ellipsis\f* , and if you do not pay homage to the statue at that moment you will be thrown into the furnace of burning fire and what god will deliver you from my hand?"
\v 16 And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and they said to king, "Nebuchanezzar\f + \ft disrespectful\f* , we do not need\f + \ft Peal, Part., jvj\f* concerning this to return\f + \ft Haph., Inf.\f* a word to you.
\v 17 If it be so, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the furnace of burning fire, and from your hand, O king, he will deliver us.
\v 18 But if not\f + \ft 17c\f* , let it be known\f + \ft Peal, Pass. Part.\f* to you, O king, that your gods we will not serve and we will not pay homage to the golden image which you have set up."
\v 19 Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled\f + \ft Hithpeel, Perf.\f* with rage and the image of his face was changed\f + \ft Ithpael, Perf.\f* toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He answered and said to make the furnace hot seven times over what it was customary\f + \ft Peal, Pass. Part., hzj\f* to heat it\f + \ft Peal, Inf. Con., aza\f* .
\v 20 And certain mighty men of strength who were in his army he commanded to tie up\f + \ft Pael, Inf. Con.\f* Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to throw\f + \ft Peal, Inf. Con.\f* them into the furnace of burning fire.
\v 21 Then those men were tied up\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* in their cloaks, their tunics, and their caps and their clothing, and they were thrown\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* into the furnace of burning fire.
\v 22 Therefore because the word of the king was harsh and the furnace was extraordinarily heated\f + \ft Peal, Pass. Part.\f* , these men who carried\f + \ft ?\f* Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, the flame of the fire killed\f + \ft Pael, Perf.\f* them.
\v 23 And these men, three of them, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell inside the furnace of burning fire bound\f + \ft Pael, Pass. Part.\f* .
\v 24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was amazed\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* and he stood up in haste; he answered and said to his royal officials, "Did we not throw three men into the fire bound\f + \ft Pael, Pass. Part.\f* ?" They answered and said to the king, "True, O king."
\v 25 He answered and said, "Behold I see four men loose\f + \ft Peal, Pass. Part.\f* walking inside the furnace and there is no injury in them and the appearance of the fourth is like\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* a son of the gods."
\v 26 Then Nebuchadnezzar drew near to the gate of the furnace of burning fire. He answered and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abenego, servants of the Most High God, come out\f + \ft Peal, Impv.\f* and come\f + \ft Peal, Impv.\f* .
\v 27 Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire. And the satraps, prefects, governors, and royal officials of the king assembled and saw these men, that the fire did not have power over their body and the hair of their head was not singed\f + \ft Peal, Perf., Erh\f* and their coats were not changed and odor of the fire did not pass over them.
\v 28 Nebuchanezzar answered and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego who sent his angel and recued his servants who set their trust\f + \ft Hith., Perf.\f* on him and the word of the king the violated\f + \ft Pael, Perf.\f* and they gave their bodies so that they might not serve and pay homage to any god except their God.
\v 29 And from me let there be issued\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* a decree that any people, nation, or language which speaks a thing\f + \ft ?\f* against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, the limbs will be made\f + \ft ?\f* and his house will become\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* a refuse heap because there is no other God who is able to deliver like this."
\v 30 Then the king prospered\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
\v 31 Nebuchadnezzar the king to all the peoples, nations, and languages who dwell in the whole earth: "May your peace abound!
\v 32 Signs and wonders which the Most High God has done with me it seemed good\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* to me to declare.
\v 33 How great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation."
