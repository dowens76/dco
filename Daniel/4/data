\v 1 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prosperous in my palace.
\v 2 I saw a dream and it made me afraid\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* and the fancies on my bed and the visions of my head alarmed me\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* .
\v 3 So a decree was issued\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* from me to bring in\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* before me all the wise men of Babylon that they might make known to me\f + \ft Haphel, Impf.\f* the interpretation of the dream.
\v 4 Then the magicians, the conjurers, Chaldeans, astrologers came in and I spoke the dream before them but its interpretation they did not make known\f + \ft Haphel, Part.\f* to me.
\v 5 And at last Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods, came in before me, and I spoke the dream before him.
\v 6 ‘O Belteshazzar, chief of th emagicians, since I know that a spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery oppresses\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* you, say the visions of my deam which I saw and its interpretation.
\v 7 And the visions of my head on my bed: I was looking and behold a tree was in the midst of the earth and its height was great.
\v 8 The tree grew up and became strong and its height reached to the sky and it was visible to the end of all the earth.
\v 9 It’s foliage was beautiful and its fruit was great and there was food for all in it. The beasts of the field found shade\f + \ft Aphel, Impf.\f* under it and in its branches the birds of the air lived and from it all flesh fed\f + \ft Ithpeel, Impf.\f* .
\v 10 I was looking in the vision of my head on my bed and behold a watcher, and a holy one descended\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* from heaven.
\v 11 He called with strength and thus he said, "Cut down the tree and cut off\f + \ft Pael, Impv.\f* its branches; strip off\f + \ft Aphel, Impv.\f* its foliage and scatter\f + \ft Pael, Impv.\f* its fruit; let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.
\v 12 Only leave\f + \ft Peal, Impv.\f* the stump its roots in the ground and with a band of iron and bronze ; in the grass of the field and with dew of the sky it will wet\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* and with the beast its portion is in the grass of the earth.
\v 13 His heart from man will be changed\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* and the heart of a beast will be given to him and seven years\f + \ft times\f* will pass over him.
\v 14 By the decree of the watchers is the command and from the command of the holy ones is the request so that the living may know that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of man and to whoever he wishes he gives it and he sets over it the low of men.
\v 15 This is the dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw and you Belteshazzar, tell its interpretation because all the wise men of the kingdom were not able to make known to me the intepretation and you are able because a spirit of the holy gods is in you.
\v 16 Then Daniel whose name is Belteshazzar, was appalled\f + \ft Ethpoel, Perf.\f* for a moment and his thoughts alarmed him\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* . The king answered and said, "Belteshazzar, do not let the dream and its interpretation alarm you\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* ." Belteshazzar answered and he said, "My lord,\f + \ft if only\f* the dream to your foes and its interpretation to your enemies.
\v 17 The tree which you saw, which grew and strengthened and its height reached to heaven and was visible to all the earth,
\v 18 And its foliage was beautiful and its fruit was great and was food for all in it, under which the beasts of the field dwelled and the birds of the air dwelled in its branches,
\v 19 It is you, O king, for you have become great and you have strengthened and your greatness has grown great and has reached\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* to heaven and your dominion to the end of the earth.
\v 20 And that the king saw a watcher and a holy one descend from heaven and say, "Chop down the tree and destroy it\f + \ft Pael, Impv.\f* but the stump of its roots in the earth leave and with a band of iron and bronze in the grass of the field and with the dew of heaven let it wet\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* and with the beast of the field shall be its portion until seven times pass by it.
\v 21 This is the interpretation, O king, and the decree of the Most High which has come upon my lord the king:
\v 22 And you they will drive\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* from men and with the beasts of the field shall your dwelling place be and the grass like cattle will feed\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* you and from the dew of the sky they will wet\f + \ft Pael, Part.\f* you and seven times will pass by you until when you know that the Most High is ruler over the kingdom of man and he gives it to whomever he wishes.
\v 23 And that they commanded to leave the stump of its roots of the tree, your kingdom will be secure to you from when you know that heaven has mastery.
\v 24 Therefore, O king, may my advice be acceptable to you and your sins break off\f + \ft Peal, Impv.\f* by right-doing and your iniquity by showing favor to the poor if there might be prolonging your prosperity."
\v 25 All this came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.
\v 26 At the end of twelve months on the palace of the kingdom of Babylon he was walking about\f + \ft Pael, Part.\f* .
\v 27 The king answered and said, "Is this not Babylon the great which I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty?"
\v 28 The word was still in the mouth of the king when a voice from heaven fell, "To you it is said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, the kingdom has been removed\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* from you,
\v 29 and from men you will be driven and with the beast of the field will be your dwelling place, the grass like cattle will feed you and seven times will pass by you until you you that the Most High is having mastery over the kingdom of man and to whomever he desires he gives it."
\v 30 In that moment the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* and from men he was driven away\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* and the grace like cattle he ate and from the dew of heaven his body was wet\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* until his hair grew like a vulture/eagle and his fingernails were like birds.
\v 31 And at the end of those days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* my eyes to heaven and my knowledge returned to me and the Most High I blessed and the one who lives forever I praised and glorified for his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation.
\v 32 And all those who dwell on the earth are accounted\f + \ft Peal, Pass. Part.\f* as nothing and as he desires he does with the army of heaven and those who dwell on the earth and there is no one who can hinder\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* his hand or say to him, "What have you done?"
\v 33 At that time my knowledge returned to me and for the honor of my kingdom, majesty and splendor returned to me and to me my counselors and my nobles were seeking me and over my kingdom I was reestablished\f + \ft Hophal, Perf.\f* and extraordinary greatness was added\f + \ft Hophal, Perf.\f* to me.
\v 34 Now Nebuchadnezzar praise and exalt and glorify\f + \ft Pael, Part.\f* the King of Heaven for all his works are truth and his ways just and those who walk in pride he is able to humble\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* ."
