\v 1 And Darius the Mede received\f + \ft Pael, Perf.\f* the kingdom about the age of sixty-two.
\v 2 It seemed good to Darius and he set up over the kingdom 120 satraps that they should be over all the kingdom.
\v 3 And above them were three chiefs of whom Daniel was one, that these satraps might give report\f + \ft ?\f* to them and that the king might not suffer injury\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* .
\v 4 Then this Daniel distinguished himself over the chiefs and the satraps because an extraordinary spirit was in him and the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.
\v 5 Then the chiefs and the satraps were seeking to find a ground for accusation against Daniel from the side of the kingdom but no ground of accusation or fault were they able to find because he was trustworthy and they found no negligence or fault against him.
\v 6 Then those men said, "We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him in the law of his God."
\v 7 Then these chiefs and satraps stormed in to the king and thus they said to him, "King Darius, live forever!
\v 8 All the chiefs of the kingdom, the prefects, the satraps, the counselors, the governors consulted together that the king should issue a decree and make it strong\f + \ft Pael, Inf.\f* with a prohibition that anyone who seeks a petition from any god or man for thirty days except from you, O king, will be thrown into the den of lions.
\v 9 Now, O king, set up\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* the interdict and sign\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* the document that is not to be changed\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* according to the law of the Medes and Persians which will not pass away\f + \ft Peal, Impf.\f* .
\v 10 Therefore King Darius signed the document, that is, the interdict.
\v 11 And Daniel when he knew that the document was signed\f + \ft Peil, Impf., 3ms\f* , he went into his house and his windows were open\f + \ft Peal, Pass. Part.\f* in his roof chamber facing Jerusalem and three times in the day he kneeled down\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* on his knees and prayed\f + \ft Pael, Part.\f* and gave thanks\f + \ft Aphel, Part.\f* before his God as he was doing before this.
\v 12 Then those men stormed in\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* and they found Daniel seeking and imploring\f + \ft Hithpaal, Part\f* before his God.
\v 13 Then they approached and they said before the King concerning the interdict of the King, "Did you not sign an interdict that any man who seeks from any God or man for thirty days except from you, O king, will be thrown\f + \ft Hith., Impf.\f* into the den of lions?" The king answered and he said, "The word is true, according to the law of the Medes and the Persians which will not pass away."
\v 14 Then they answered and they said before the king, "Daniel who is one of the exiles of Judah did not pay attention\f + \ft Peal, Perf., including t'em\f* to you, O king, or to the interdict which you signed but three times in the day he makes his petition."
\v 15 Then the king, when he heard the matter it was greatly displeasing to him\f + \ft King or of Daniel?\f* and concerning Daniel he set his mind to rescue him and until the going in of the sun he was struggling\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* to deliver him\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* .
\v 16 Then those men stormed in to the king and they said to the king, "Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and the Persians that every interdict and decree which the king establishes is not to change\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* .
\v 17 Then the king ordered and they brought\f + \ft Haphel, Perf., hta\f* Daniel and threw him into the den of lions. The king answered and said to Daniel, "Your God whom you serve continually, may he deliver you\f + \ft Kyle/Dr. Magary: he will deliver you--based on the fronted pronoun\f* ."
\v 18 A stone was brought\f + \ft Hephal, Perf.\f* and placed over the mouth of the den and the king sealed\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* with his signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles so that nothing might be changed with regard to Daniel.
\v 19 Then the king went away to his palace and passed the night\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* fasting and entertainment was not brought in\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* before him and his sleep fled\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* from him.
\v 20 Then the king rose at dawn, at the daylight, and hurried\f + \ft Hithpeel, Inf.\f* to out to the den of lions.
\v 21 And as he came near to the den, to Daniel with a troubled voice he cried out and the king answered and said to Daniel, "Daniel, servant of the living God, was your God, whom you serve continually, able\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* to deliver you from the lions?
\v 22 Then Daniel spoke with the king, "O king, live forever!"
\v 23 My God sent his angel and he shut the mouth of the lions and they did not hurt me\f + \ft Pael, Perf.\f* because before him innocence was found for me\f + \ft Hith., Perf.\f* and also before you, O king, I have not done damage.
\v 24 Then the king was very glad\f + \ft Peal, Perf., baf\f* because of it ordered for Daniel to be brought up\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* from the den and Daniel was brought up\f + \ft Hophal, Perf.\f* from the den and no injury was found in him because he trusted\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* in his God.
\v 25 And the king ordered and they brought those men who maliciously accused him, that is Daniel, and they cast them, their children, and their wives into the den of lions and they did not reach\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* the bottom of the den before the lions had overpowered them and all their bones they crushed\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* .
\v 26 Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages who were living in all the land, "May your peace grow great!
\v 27 From before me a decree is issued\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* that in all the dominion of my kindgom\f + \ft people\f* will tremble and fear from before Daniel's God for he is the living God, enduring forever and his kingdom is one which will not be damaged and his dominion will be until the end.
\v 28 He delivers and he saves and he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth, who has delivered Daniel from the hand of the lions."
\v 29 And this Daniel prospered\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* in the kingdom of Darius and in the kingdom of Cyrus the Persian.
