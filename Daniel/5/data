\v 1 Belshazzar the king made a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and before the thousand he was drinking wine.
\v 2 Belshazzar commanded a decree with the wine to bring\f + \ft Haphel, Inf.\f* the vessels of gold and silver which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought out from the temple in Jerusalem that the king and his nobles, his consorts, and his concubines may drink with them.
\v 3 Then they brought vessels of gold which they had brought out from the temple of the house of God which is in Jerusalem and the king and his nobles and his wives and concubines drank with them.
\v 4 They drank\f + \ft Peal, Perf.\f* wine and they praised the gods of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
\v 5 In that moment fingers of the hand of man came out and wrote opposite the lampstand on the plaster of the wall of the palace of the king and the king saw the palm of the hand which wrote.
\v 6 Then the king, his brightness changed and his thoughts alarmed him and the joints of his loin loosened\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* and his knees knocked\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* each other.
\v 7 The king shouted aloud to bring in the conjurors, Chaldeans, and astrologers; the King answered and said to the wise men of Bablyon, "Anyone who reads this inscription and makes known its interpretation to me\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* will be clothed\f + \ft peal, Impf.\f* in purple and the necklace of gold will be on his neck and he will rule third in the kingdom."
\v 8 Then all the wise men of the king came in and they were not able to read the inscription or to make known the interpretation to the king.
\v 9 Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed and his brightness changed over it and his nobles were perplexed\f + \ft Hithpaal, Part.\f* .
\v 10 The queen because of the word of the king and nobles entered the banquet hall. The queen answered and said, "O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you\f + \ft Pael, Impf.\f* or your brightness change.
\v 11 There is a man in your kingdom in whom is a spirit of the holy gods and in the days of your father illumination and insight and wisdom as the wisdom of God was found in him and King Nebuchadnezzar your father appointed him chief of the magicians, conjurors, Chaldeans, and astrologers.
\v 12 Because of an extraordinary spirit and knowledge and insight he interprets\f + \ft Pael, Part.\f* dreams and declaration of riddles and loosing knots were found in him, in Daniel whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel read and make known the interpretation."
\v 13 Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The King answered and said to Daniel, "Are you Daniel who is from the exiles of Judah which my father the king brought from Judah?
\v 14 And I have heard concerning you that a spirit of the gods is in you and illumination and insight and extraordinary wisdom was found in you.
\v 15 And now the wise men, conjurers were bought in\f + \ft Hophal, Perf.\f* before me that they might read this inscription and make known to me its interpretation and they were not able to make known the interpretation.
\v 16 And I heard concerning you that you are able to make intepretations and to loosen knots. Now if you are able to read the inscription and to make known to me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple and the necklace of gold will be on your neck and you will rule as the third in the kingdom.
\v 17 Then Daniel answered and he said before the king, "Your gifts will be for you, or your rewards give\f + \ft Peal, Impv.\f* to another, only I will read the inscription to the king and the interpretation I will make known.
\v 18 You, O king, the Most High God gave to Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, greatness, glory, and majesty.
\v 19 And from the greatness which he gave to him all the peoples, nations, and languages were trembling and fearing from before him; whoever he wished he killed and hwoever he wished he let live\f + \ft Aphel, Part.\f* and whoever he wisshed he lifted up\f + \ft Aphel, Part.\f* and whoever he wished he humbled\f + \ft Aphel, Part.\f* .
\v 20 But when his heart was lifted\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* and his spirit grew strong so that he acted proudly he was brought down from the throne of his kingdom and the honor was taken away from him.
\v 21 and from mankind he was driven\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* and his heart was like the beasts and his dwelling place was with the wild donkeys, grass like cattle fed him and from the dew of heaven his body was wet until he knew that the Most High God has mastery over the kingdom of men and to whomever he wishes he establishes over it.
\v 22 But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart although you new all this.
\v 23 And over the Lord of Heaven you exalted yourself and they brought the vessels of his house before you and you and your nobles, your consorts, and your concubines drank wine with them and to the gods of silver and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone which do not see and do not hear and do not know, you gave praise but the God in whose hand is your breth and all your ways are his you did not glorify.
\v 24 Then from before him the palm of the hand was sent and this inscription was written\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* .
\v 25 And this is the inscription which was written: ‘Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin\f + \ft Mina, mina, shekel, half mina\f* .’
\v 26 This is the intepretation of the word: ‘Mene’
\p —God has numbered your kingdom and has finished it\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* .
\v 27 ‘Tekel’—you have been weighed\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* on the scale and you were found lacking.
\v 28 ‘Peres’—your kindom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians.
\v 29 Then Belshazzar ordered and they clothed Daniel with purple and the necklace of gold on his neck and they proclaimed\f + \ft Haphel, Perf.\f* concerning him that he was third ruler in the kingdom.
\v 30 On that night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was killed\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* .
