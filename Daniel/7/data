\v 1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head on his bed. Then he wrote the dream of his head and said utterances.
\v 2 Daniel answered and said, "I was looking in my vision by night and behold the four winds of heaven agitated\f + \ft Aphel, Part.\f* the great sea.
\v 3 And four great beasts were coming up from the sea, changing from this to this.
\v 4 The first was like a lion and had wings of an eagle. It was looking until its wings were cut off and it was lifted from the earth and on two feet like a man it was made to stand and the heart of man was given to it.
\v 5 And behold another beast, a second one, resembling a bear. And on one side it was raised and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. And thus they said to it, "Arise, eat much flesh!"
\v 6 After this I was looking and behold another, like a leopard, which had four wings of a bird on its back and the beast had four heads and dominion was given to it.
\v 7 After this I was looking and in the visions of the night and behold I was seeing fourth, dreadful and terrible and very strong and it had large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed and trampled the remainder with its feet and it was different from all the beasts which were before it and it had ten horns.
\v 8 I was considering\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* the horns and behold another horn, a little one, came up between them and three of the first horns were plucked\f + \ft Ithpeel, Perf.\f* from before it and behold eyes like eyes of man were in this horn and its mouth spoke great\f + \ft boasts?\f* .
\v 9 I was looking until thrones were set up\f + \ft Peil, Perf.\f* and the Ancient of Days sat down; his garment was like white snow and the hair of his head was like pure wool; his throne was a flame of fire; its wheels were a burning fire\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* .
\v 10 A river of fire was flowing\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* and going out from before Him; thousand of thousands were ministering to him and a multitude of multitudes was standing before him; the court sat and books opened.
\v 11 I was looking then from the sound of great words which the horn was speaking; I was looking until the beast was killed and its body was destroyed and given into the burning fire.
\v 12 And the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away and the prolonging of living was given to them until a season and time.
\v 13 I was looking in the visions of the night and behold with the clouds of heaven was one like a son of man coming. And unto the Ancient of Days he reached and they brought him near before him.
\v 14 And to him was given dominion and honor and kingdom and all the peoples, nations, and languages will serve him; his dominiion is an everlasting dominionwhich will not pass away and his kingdom is one which will not be destroyed\f + \ft Hithpaal, Impf.\f* .
\v 15 My spirit was distressed\f + \ft Ithpeel, Perf.\f* , I Daniel, inside me and the visions of my head alarmed me.
\v 16 I approached one of those standing\f + \ft Peal, Part.\f* and I asked from him the truth concerning all this and he said to me and the interpretation of the word he made known to me.
\v 17 These great beasts which are four are four kings who will rise from the earth.
\v 18 and sains of the Most High will receive the kingdom and take possession of the kingdom forever and ever and ever.
\v 19 Then I wished ot make certain\f + \ft Pael, Inf.\f* concerning the fourth beast which was different from all of them, exceedingly dreadful, its teeth of iron and its fingernails of bronze, devoured, crushed, and the rest trampled under its feet.
\v 20 And concerning the ten horns which were on his head and the other which came up and the three fell from before it and that horn which had eyes and the mouth speaking great things and whose appearance was greater than its fellows.
\v 21 I was looking and that horn was making war with the sains and overpowering them.
\v 22 Until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High and the time arrived and the saints took possession of the kingdom.
\v 23 Thus he said, â€˜The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth which will be different from all the kingdoms and it will devour the earth and tread it down and crush it.
\v 24 And the ten horns: out of it, the kingdom, ten kings will arise and another will arise after them and it will be different from them and three kings it will humble\f + \ft Haphel, Impf.\f* .
\v 25 And words to the side of the Most High he will speak and to the saints of the Most High he will harrass and think to change times and law and they will be given into his hand for a time, times, and a half time.
\v 26 And the court will sit and his dominion will be taken away\f + \ft Haphel, Impf.\f* to annihilate and destroy until the end.
\v 27 And the kingdom and dominion and greatness of the kingdoms under all heaven will be given to the people of the saints of the Most High; his kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom and all the dominions will serve him and obey.
\v 28 Until this was the end of the word. I, Daniel, my thoughts were greatly alarming me and my brightness changed on me but the matter I kept in my heart.
