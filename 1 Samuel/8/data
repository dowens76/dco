\v 1 And it happened when Samuel was old that he set\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* his sons as judges\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* for Israel.
\v 2 And the name of his first-born son was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah who were judging\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* in Beersheba.
\v 3 And his sons did not go\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* in his way and they turned\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* after the unjust gain and they took\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* a bribe and they turned\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* from judgement.
\v 4 And all the elders gathered together\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hith., Imp., VC\f* and they came\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* to Samuel to Ramah.
\v 5 And they said to him, "Behold you are old\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Per.\f* and you sons are not going\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per\f* in your ways. Now please set up\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Emph. Impv.\f* for us a king to judge us\f + \ft Q, IC\f* like all the nations."
\v 6 And the word was evil\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* in the eyes of Samuel when they said "give\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv?\f* to us a king to judge us\f + \ft Q, IC\f* ," and Samuel prayed\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hith., Imp., VC\f* to the Lord.
\v 7 And the Lord said to Samuel, "Obey\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* the people in all that they have said\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* to you because they have not rejected\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* you because they have rejected\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* me from reigning\f + \ft Q, IC\f* over them.
\v 8 According to all the deeds which they have done\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* from the day which I brought them up\f + \ft HI, IC\f* out of Egypt and until this day and they have forsaken\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* and they ahve served\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* other gods so they are doing\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* also to you.
\v 9 And not obey\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* them, only when surely\f + \ft Hi., IA\f* warn\f + \ft 2, M, S, Hi., Imp.\f* them and tell\f + \ft 2, M, S, Hi., Per., VC\f* to them the judgement of the king who shall reign\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* over them."
\v 10 And Samuel spoke all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* for a king from him.
\v 11 And he said, "This shall be the judgement of the king who shall reign\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* over you: he shall take\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* your children and he shall set\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* for himself in his chariots and in his horsemen and they shall run\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per., VC\f* before his chariots.
\v 12 And to place\f + \ft Q, IC\f* for himself officers of thousands and officers of fifties and to plow\f + \ft Q, IC\f* his plowing and to reap\f + \ft Q, IC\f* his harvest and to make\f + \ft Q, IC\f* his weapons of war and equipment of his chariot.
\v 13 And he shall take\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* your daughters to make perfume and to slaughter and to bake.
\v 14 And your fields and your vineyards and your olives, the best ones, he shall take\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and he shall give\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* for his servants.
\v 15 And your seed and your vineyards he shall tithe\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and he shall give\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* to his court officials and his slaves.
\v 16 And your slaves and your female servants and your young men, the best ones, and your donkeys he shall take\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and he shall make\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* for his work.
\v 17 Your sheep he shall tithe\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and you shall be servants for him.
\v 18 And you shall cry out\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* on that day from before your king which you have selected\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per.\f* for yourselves and the Lord shall not answer\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* you on that day."
\v 19 And the people refused\f + \ft 3, M, P, Pi., Imp.\f* to listen\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to the voice of Samuel and they said, "No, except there shall be a king over us.
\v 20 And even we shall be like al the nations and our king shall judge us\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* and he shall go out\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* before us and he shall fight\f + \ft 3, M, S, Ni., Per.\f* your battles."
\v 21 And Smaule heard\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* all the words of the people and he spoke them\f + \ft 3, M, S, Pi., Imp., VC\f* in the ears of the Lord.
\v 22 And the Lord said to Samuel, "Obey them\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* and you shall cause a king to rule\f + \ft 2, M, S, Hi, Per., VC\f* for them," and Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Go\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Impv.\f* each man to his city."
