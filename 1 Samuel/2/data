\v 1 And Hannah prayed and she said:
\q1 "My heart rejoices in the Lord, my strength rises in the Lord
\q1 My mouth is wide against my enemies because I am glad in Your deliverance.
\q1
\v 2 There is no one holy like the Lord because there is no one besides you,
\q1 and there is no refuge like our God.
\q1
\v 3 Do not speak much with pride; arrogance shall not go out from you mouth
\q1 because the Lord is a God of knowledge and to Him deeds are weighed.
\q1
\v 4 Bows of mighty men are broken and weak ones put on strength.
\q1
\v 5 The ones who are satisfied with bread are being hired and the ones who are hungry cease;
\q1 still the barren bear seven but with many sons she loses fertility
\q1
\v 6 The Lord from death and from life causes one to go down to Sheol and to come up.
\q1
\v 7 The Lord impoverishes and He causes one to be rich, He brings low also bringing high.
\q1
\v 8 He raises up the weak from the dust, from the refuse heap He raises the needy
\q1 to cause them to sit with nobles and a seat of honor he causes them to inherit
\q1 because the pillars of the earth are the Lord's and He places upon them the world.
\q1
\v 9 The feet of the kind He guards and the wicked ones in darkness are made silent
\q1 because not by strength shall a man prevail.
\q1
\v 10 The Lord, His contenders shall be shattered; the Most High in the heavens shall thunder;
\q1 the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth, and He shall give strength to His king
\q1 And He shall exalt the horn\f + \ft strength\f* of His annointed one.

\v 11 And Elkanah went to his house at Ramatah and the lad was serving the Lord before Eli the priest.
\v 12 And the sons of Eli were sons of worthlessness, they did not know the Lord
\v 13 and the custom of the priests with the people. For every man sacrificing a sacrifice a lad of the priest came as the flesh was boiling and the three tooth fork in his hand.
\v 14 And he would strike in the basin or the cooking pot or the pot or the cooking pot all which the fork brought up the priest took with himself. Thus they did for all Israel coming there in Shiloh.
\v 15 Also before they sacrificed the fat a lad of the priest came and he said to the man of the sacrifice, "Give flesh to roast for the priest and he will not take from you flesh which was boiled but raw."
\v 16 And the man would say to him, "Surely they will sacrifice the fat as the day and take for yourself as your soul desires," and he would say to him that "Now, give and if not, I will take by strength."
\v 17 And the sin of the lads was very great before the Lord because the men spurned the offering of the Lord.
\v 18 And Samuel was serving before the Lord, a lad wearing a white linen ephod.
\v 19 And his mother made for him a small robe and she brought it up to him from year to year when she went up with her husband to sacrifice a sacrifice of the year.
\v 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and he would say, "May the Lord shall place seed for you from this wife instead of the request which she requested for the Lord." And they went to their home.
\v 21 Surely the Lord attended to Hannah and she conceived and she bore three sons and two daughers. And the lad Samuel became great with the Lord.
\p
\v 22 And Eli was exceedingly old and he heard all which his sons did to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 23 And he said to them, "Why did you do as these deeds which I am hearing, evil things from all these people?
\v 24 No my sons, for the news is not good which I am hearing passing through the people of the Lord.
\v 25 If a man should sin against another then God shall arbitrate, but if a man should sin against the Lord, who shall arbitrate for him?" And they shall not obey their father for the Lord wanted to kill them.
\v 26 And the lad Samuel walked and he became great and good even with the Lord and also with men.
\p
\v 27 And a man of God came to Eli and he said to him, "Thus saith the Lord, 'Did I surely reveal myself to the house of your father in in their days in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh?
\v 28 And I chose him from all the tribes of Israel for me to be priest to go up upon my altar to offer incense, to carry an ephod before Me and I gave to the house of your father all of the fire of the children of Israel.
\v 29 Why do you kick\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* my sacrifice and my offering which I have commanded\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* a dwelling and you have honored\f + \ft 2, M, S, Pi., Imp.\f* your sons more than me for you to create\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* from the first of all the offering of Israel my people.'
\v 30 Therefore the declaration of the Lord the God of Israel I have surely said\f + \ft Q, IA; 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* : your house and the house of your father shall walk\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hith., Imp.\f* before me forever and now the declaration of the Lord this night to me that the one who honors me\f + \ft M, S, Pi., Part.\f* I shall honor\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Imp.\f* and those who despise me\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* shall be slight\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* .
\v 31 Behold days are coming\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* when I shall cut off\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per., VC\f* your seed and the seed of your father's house from there being an old man in your house.
\v 32 And you shall look\f + \ft 2, M, S, Hi., Per., VC\f* at distress of the dwelling in all which shall be good\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp.\f* with Israel and there shall not be an old man in your house all the days.
\v 33 And I shall not cut off\f + \ft 1, C, S, Hi., Imp.\f* a man for you for my altar to complete\f + \ft Q, IC\f* your eyes and to grieve\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* your soul and all of the multitude of your house men shall die\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* .
\v 34 And this shall be the sign for you which shall come\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* to your two sons to Hophni and Phinehas: on one day the two of them shall die\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* .
\v 35 And I shall set up\f + \ft 1, C, S, Hi., Per., VC\f* for myself a priest who is faithful\f + \ft M, S, Ni., Part.\f* and he shall walk\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hith., Per.\f* before my annointed one all the days.
\v 36 And it shall happen that every one who remains\f + \ft M, S, Ni., Part.\f* in your house shall come\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* to bow down\f + \ft Hish., IC\f* to him for payment of silver and as a loaf of bread and he shall say\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* , 'Please attach me\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* to one of the priesthood to eat\f + \ft Q, IC\f* a piece of bread.'"
