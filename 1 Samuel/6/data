\v 1 And it happened that the ark of the Lord was in the country of the Philistines for seven months.
\v 2 And the Philistines called\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* to the priests and to the diviners saying, "What shall we do\f + \ft 1, C, P, Q, Imp.\f* with the ark of the Lord? Make us know\f + \ft M, P, Hi., Impv.\f* with what we shall send\f + \ft 1, C, P, Pi., Imp.\f* it to its place.
\v 3 And the said, "If you are sending\f + \ft M, P, Pi., Part.\f* the ark of the God of Israel, do not sent\f + \ft 2, M, P, Pi., Imp.\f* it empty but you shall surely\f + \ft Hi., IA\f* return\f + \ft 2, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* to Him a guilt offering then you shall be healed\f + \ft 2, M, P, Ni., Imp.\f* and it shall be known\f + \ft 3, M, S, Ni., Per., VC\f* to you why His hand is not turning\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Imp.\f* from you."
\v 4 And they said, "What is the guilt offering which we shall return\f + \ft 1, C, P, Hi., Imp.\f* to Him?" And they said, "The number of the lords of the Philistines, five tumors of gold and five mice of gold because one plague was for all of you and all of your lords."
\v 5 And you shall make\f + \ft 2, M, P, Hi., Imp., VC\f* images of your tumors and images of your mice the ones who spoiled\f + \ft M, P, Hi., Part.\f* the land and you shall give\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* to the God of Israel honor; perhaps He shall cause his hand to be small\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp.\f* from upon you and from upon your gods and from upon your land.
\v 6 And Why shall do you harden\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* your heart as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened\f + \ft 3, M, P, Pi., Per.\f* their heart? Was it not so when He dealt severly\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hith., Per.\f* with them that they sent them\f + \ft 3, M, P, Pi., Imp., VC\f* and they went\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* ?
\v 7 Now take\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* and do\f + \ft M, P, Q, Impv.\f* one new cart and two cows giving suck\f + \ft F, P, Q, Part.\f* upon which a yoke has never ascended\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* and you shall tie\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* the cows to the cart and you shall return\f + \ft 2, M, P, Hi., Per., VC\f* their sons from behind them to the house.
\v 8 And you shall take\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* the ark of the Lord and you shall give\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* it to the cart and the vessels of gold which you shall return\f + \ft 2, M, P, Hi., Per.\f* to Him as a guilt offering you shall place\f + \ft 2, M, P, Hi., Imp.\f* in the saddlebag on its side and you shall send\f + \ft 2, M, P, Pi., Per., VC\f* it and it shall go\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per., VC\f* .
\v 9 And you shall see\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Per., VC\f* if it shall go up\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* the way of its boundary to Bether-shemesh, he has done\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* to us this great evil and if not then we shall know\f + \ft 1, C, P, Q, Per.\f* that His hand has not struck\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Per.\f* us; it was chance for us."
\p
\v 10 And the men did\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* so and they took\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* two cows giving suck\f + \ft F, P, Q, Part.\f* and they tied\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* them to the cart and they shut up\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Per.\f* their sons in the house.
\v 11 And they placed\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* the ark of the Lord on the cart and the saddlebag and the mice of gold and the images of tumors.
\v 12 And the cows went straight\f + \ft 3, F, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* in the way on the road to Beth-shemesh on the highway going\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* continually\f + \ft Q, IA\f* and lowing\f + \ft Q, IC\f* and they did not turn\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* to the right or to the left and the lords of the Philistines were going\f + \ft M, P, Q, Per.\f* after them until the boundary of Beth-shemesh.
\v 13 And Beth-shemesh was reaping\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* a harvest of wheat in the valley and they lifted\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* their eyes and they saw\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* the ark and they rejoiced\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* to see\f + \ft Q, IC\f* it.
\v 14 And the cart came\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Per.\f* to the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite and it stood\f + \ft 3, F, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* there and there was a great stone and they split\f + \ft 3, M, P, Pi., Imp., VC\f* the wood of the cart and they sacrificed\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Per.\f* the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.
\v 15 And the Levites brought down\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Per.\f* the ark of the Lord and the box which was with it the articles of gold which were in it and they placed\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* them on the great stone and the men of Beth-shemesh made a burnt offering\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Per.\f* and they made sacrifices\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* on that day to the Lord.
\v 16 And the five lords of the Philistines saw\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* and they returned\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* to Ekron on that day.
\p
\v 17 And these tumors of gold which the Philistines returned\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Per.\f* as a guilt offering to the Lord, one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron.
\v 18 And the mice of gold numbered all the cities of the Philistines to five lords from a fortified city and even to a rural village and as far as a great meadow where they caused the ark of the Lord to rest\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hi., Per.\f* in her until this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.
\v 19 And he struck\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* the men of Beth-shemesh because they saw\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* in the ark of the Lord and he struck\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* in the city 50,070 men and the people mourned\f + \ft 3, M, P, Hith., Imp., VC\f* for themselves because the Lord struck\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Per.\f* in the city a great wound.
\v 20 And the men of Beth-Shemesh said\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* , "Who is able\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* to stand\f + \ft Q, IC\f* before the Lord, this holy God? And to whom shall he go up\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* from upon us?"
\v 21 And they sent\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* messengers to the inhabitants\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* of Kiriath jearim saying, "The Philistines have returned\f + \ft 3, C, P, Hi., Per.\f* the ark of the Lord go down\f + \ft M, P, Q, Impv.\f* and bring it up\f + \ft M, P, Hi., Impv.\f* to you.
