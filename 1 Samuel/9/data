\v 1 And there was a man from Benjamin and his name was Kish, son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, a man of Benjamin, a mighty man of power.
\v 2 And he had a son and his name was Saul, a young man and handsome and there was not a man from the sons of Israel who was more handsome that he; from his shoulders and up he was taller than all the people.
\v 3 And the she-donkeys of Kish the father of Saul were lost\f + \ft 3, F, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* and Kish said to Saul his son, "Please take\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* with you one from the lads and arise\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* and go\f + \ft 2, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* seek\f + \ft 2, M, S, Pi., Impv.\f* the she-donkeys."

Perhaps he shall tell\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp.\f* to us our way which we have walked\f + \ft 1, C, P, Q, Per.\f* on."
\v 7 And Saul said to his lad, "Now behold we shall go\f + \ft 1, C, P, Q, Imp.\f* and what shall we bring\f + \ft 1, C, P, Hi., Imp.\f* to the man because the bread has gone\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* from our gear and there is not a gift to bring\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* to the man of God.

\v 10 And Saul said to his lad, "Your word is good. God and let us go," and they went to the city where there was the man of God.
\p
\v 11 They were ascending\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* up into the city and they found\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* maids going out\f + \ft F, P, Q, Part.\f* to draw\f + \ft Q, IC\f* water and they said to them, "Is there a seer in this place?"

\v 13 As you come\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to thye city thus you shall find\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* him before he shall ascend\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* the high places to eat\f + \ft Q, IC\f* because the people shall not eat\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* until he has come\f + \ft Q, IC\f* because he shall bless\f + \ft 3, M, S, Pi., Imp.\f* the sacrifice; after this the ones who were called\f + \ft M, P, Pu., Part.\f* shall eat\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* and now go up\f + \ft M, P, Q, Impv.\f* because him, you shall find\f + \ft 2, M, P, Q, Imp.\f* as this day."
