\v 17 And the one who brought news\f + \ft M, S, Pi., Part.\f* answered\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* and he said, "Israel has fled\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* before the Philistines and there was also a great slaughter in the people and also your two sons have died\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Per.\f* , Hophni and Phinehas, and the ark of God was taken\f + \ft 3, F, S, ni., Per.\f* ."
