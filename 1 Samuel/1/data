\v 1 And there was one man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill country of Ephraim and his name was Elkana son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite,
\v 2 and he had two wives, one was named Hannah and the second was named Peninnah. And Peninah had children and Hannah had no children.
\v 3 And that man went up from his city yearly to bow down and to sacrifice to the Lord of hosts in Shiloh, and the two sons of Eli,Hophni and Phinehas, were priests for the Lord.
\v 4 And the day came and Elkanah sacrificed and he gave portions to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and her daughters.
\v 5 And he gave two portions to Hannah because he loved Hannah and the Lord had shut her womb.
\v 6 And her adversary provoked her even to irritate in the passing of her rage\f + \ft ????\f* because the Lord had closed in as far as her womb.
\v 7 And thus she did year after year as often as she went up to the house of the Lord thus she provoked her and she wept and she did not eat.
\v 8 And Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep and why do you not eat and why is your heart afraid\f + \ft sad?\f* ? Am I not better for you that ten sons?"
\v 9 And Hannah arose after she ate in Shiloh and after she drank and Eli the priest was sitting on the throne by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.
\v 10 And she was grieved of life and she prayed to the Lord and she surely wept.
\v 11 And she vowed a vow and she said, "The Lord of Hosts if You surely see my suffering your maidservant then remember me and do not forget your maidservant and please give you your servant seed of men and I shall give him to the Lord all the days of his life and a razor shall not go up on his head.
\v 12 And it came to pass that she increased her praying before the Lord and Eli was observing her mouth.
\v 13 And Hannah was speaking upon her heart only her lips ???? and he did not hear her voice and Eli thought her to be drunk.
\v 14 And Eli said to her, "How long shall you be drunk? Put away your wine from upon you."
\v 15 And Hannah answered and she said, "No my lord, I am a woman melancholy of spirit and I have not drunk wine or strong drink but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.
\v 16 Do not give your maidservant before daughter of worthlessness because from much of my complaint and my sorrow I have spoken until them\f + \ft ???\f* .
\v 17 And Eli answered and he said, "Go with peace and the God of Israel shall give you request which you asked from with Him."
\v 18 And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your eyes." And the woman went to her way and she ate and her mouth was not for her still.
\v 19 And they get up early in the morning and they bowed down before the Lord and they returned and they came to their house to Ramah and Elkana knew Hannah his wifeand the Lord remembered her.
\v 20 And it came to pass for ??? days that Hannah conceived and she bore a son and she called his name Samuel because "From the Lord I have requested him."
\v 21 And the man Elkanah went up and all his house to sacrifice to the Lord the sacrifice of the days and his vow.
\v 22 And Hannah did not go up because she said to her husband, "When this lad has been weaned then I will bring him and he shall appear before the Lord and he shall reside there forever."
\v 23 And Elkanah her husband said to her "Do the best in your eyes, return when you have weaned him only the Lord shall set up His word," and the woman sat and she nursed her son until she weaned him.
\v 24 And she brought him up when she had weaned him with three bulls and one ephah of meal and a bottle of wine and she brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh and the lad was young.
\v 25 And they slaughtered teh bull and they brought the lad to Eli.
\v 26 And she said, "Please my lord, as the life of your soul my lord, I am the woman who was standing with\f + \ft you??\f* in this place to pray to the Lord.
\v 27 I prayed for this lad and the Lord has given to me my request which I requested from Him.
\v 28 And also I requested him for the Lord all the days which he is living for a request for the Lord," and they ??? there for the Lord.
