\v 11 For the grace of God appeared, that is bringing salvation for all people,
\v 12 teaching us in order that we might refuse impiety and worldly desires, that we might live in a self-controlled and righteous and godly manner in this present age,

\v 14 who gave himself for us, in order that he might redeem us from all lawlessness and that he might cleanse for himself a people for his possession, a people zealous for good works.
