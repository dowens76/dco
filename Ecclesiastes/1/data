\v 1 The words of the speaker, son of David, king in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Vanity of vanities, said the speaker, vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
\v 3 What profit is there for man in all his effort, which he exerts under the sun?
\v 4 Generation comes and generation goes, and the earth stands forever.
\v 5 The sun rises and the sun goes, and to its place it pants, it rises there.
\v 6 Going to the south and circling to the north, the wind circles around and around and to its course the wind returns.
\v 7 All the streams come to the sea, and the sea is not full to the place where the streams come, there they flow to go.
\v 8 All things are weary, a man cannot speak; the eye is not satisifed with seeing, and the ear is not filled with hearing.
\v 9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is notthing new under the sun.
\v 10 There is a thing which is said, "See, this is new." Already it has been for a long time, what was from before us.
\v 11 There is no memory of former things, and also of later things which will be there will not be any memory with those who will be later.
