\v 1 And God blessed (Piel) Noah and his sons and he said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
\v 2 And fear of you and terror of you will be on all living things of the earth and on every bird of the sky, on all which creeps on the ground and on all the fish of the sea, into your hand they are given (Niph.).
\v 3 Every creeping thing which is living will be food for you as green grass, I give to you everything.
\v 4 Only flesh with its life, its blood, you shall not eat.
\v 5 And surely your blood for your life I will seek from the hand of every living thing I will seek it and from the hand of man, from the hand of each man’s brother I will seek the life of man.
\v 6 The one who sheds the blood of man, by man his blood will be shed for in the image of God I made man.
\v 7 And you, be fruitful and multiply, teem (Jrv) in the earth and multiply in it.”
\v 8 And God said to Noah and to his sons with him saying,
\v 9 “I, behold I, raise my covenant with you and your seed after you.
\v 10 And all living flesh which is with you, with birds, with cattle, and with all living things of the earth with you from all which went out of the ark to all living things of the earth.
\v 11 And I raise my covenant with you and never again will all flesh be cut off by waters of the flood and never again will a flood ruin (tjv) the earth.”
\v 12 And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant which I am giving between me and you and every living being which is with you for generations of the ages.
\v 13 My bow I give in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
\v 14 And it will be when I make a cloud appear (Pi., Inf. Con., /nu) on the earth that the bow will be seen in the cloud.
\v 15 And I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living being among all flesh and never again will the waters become a flood to ruin all flesh.
\v 16 And the bow will be in the cloud and I will see it to remember the eternal covenant between God and every living thing among all flesh which is on the earth.”
\v 17 And god said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant which I raise between me and all flesh which is on the earth.
