\v 1 And the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.
\v 2 And God finished on the seventh day his work which he had done and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
\v 3 And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy for on it he rested from all his work which God had created to make.
\v 4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created\f + \fr 2.4: \ft Niph., Inf. Con., 3mp suff.\f* on the day the Lord God made\f + \fr 2.4: \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* earth and heaven.
\v 5 And every bush of the field was\f + \fr 2.5: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms.\f* not yet on the earth and all the grass of the field had not yet sprung up\f + \fr 2.5: \ft Qal, Perf., 3ms.\f* for the Lord God had not yet sent rain\f + \fr 2.5: \ft Hiph., Perf., 3ms.\f* on the earth and there was no man to work\f + \fr 2.5: \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* the ground.
\v 6 And a mist would ascend\f + \fr 2.6: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms.\f* from the earth and watering \f + \fr 2.6: \ft Hiph., Perf., 3ms.\f* all the face of the ground.
\v 7 And the Lord God formed\f + \fr 2.7: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms.\f* the man with dust from the ground and he breathed \f + \fr 2.7: \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms.\f* in his nostrils the breath of life and the man became \f + \fr 2.7: \ft Qal, Juss., 3ms.\f* a living being.
\v 8 And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east and he placed the man whom he had formed there.
\v 9 And the Lord God caused to grow from the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for eating and the tree of life was in the middle of the garden as well as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\v 10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided\f + \fr 2.10: \ft Niphal\f* and became four heads.
\v 11 The name of the first was Pishon; it surrounds all the land of Havilah where there is gold.
\v 12 And the gold of that land is goodl there is bdellium and carnelian stone.
\v 13 And the name of the second river was Gihon which surrounds all the land of Cush.
\v 14 And the name of the third river is Tigris which goes in front of Assyria, and the fourth is the Euphrates.
\v 15 And the Lord God took the man and placed him in the garden of Eden to work and keep it.
\v 16 And the Lord God commanded the man saying, “From all the trees of the garden you may surely eat,
\v 17 but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat because on the day you eat from it you will surely die.”
\v 18 And the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a helper as in front of him\f + \fr 2.18: \ft ?\f*.”
\v 19 And the Lord God formed from the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air and he brought them to Adam to see what he would call it and all which the man called, that was its name.
\v 20 And the man gave names to all the cattle and birds of the ear and all the beasts of the field and for the man he did not find a helper as in front of him \f + \fr 2.20: \ft (?)\f*.
\v 21 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man and he slept and he took one of his ribs and shut the flesh in its place.
\v 22 And the Lord God built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman and he brought her to the man.
\v 23 And the man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh, this will be called woman for she was taken out of man.”
\v 24 Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife and they will be one flesh.
\v 25 And the two of them, the man and his wife, were naked and not ashamed \f + \fr 2.25: \ft Hitphael.\f*.
