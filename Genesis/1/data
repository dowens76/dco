\s Creation of Heaven and Earth
\p
\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\p
\v 2 Now the earth was formless and emptiness and darkness was over the face of the deep and the Spirit of God was hovering\f + Piel, Part.\f* over the face of the waters.
\v 3 And God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light.
\v 4 And God saw the light that it was good and God divided between the light and the darkness.
\v 5 And God called the light day and the darkness he called night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
\p
\v 6 And God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters and it will divide between the waters and the waters.”
\v 7 And God made the expanse and divided between the waters which were under the expanse and the waters which were over the expanse and it was so.
\v 8 And God called the expanse sky, and there was evening and morning, the second day.
\v 9 And God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be collected into one place and let the dry land appear,” and it was so.
\v 10 And God called the dry land earth and the collection of waters he called seas, and God saw that it was good.
\v 11 And God said, “Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind in which is its seed on the earth,” and it was so.
\v 12 And the earth brought out grass, herbs bearing seed after their kind, and God saw that it was good.
\v 13 And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
\v 14 And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to divide between the day and the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.
\v 15 And let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth,” and it was so.
\v 16 And God made the two great lights, the great light to rule the day and the small light to rule the night and the stars.
\v 17 And God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light to the earth.
\v 18 And to rule over the day and over the night and to divide between the light and the darkness, and God saw that it was good.
\v 19 And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
\v 20 And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarming things of living beings and let birds fly\f + Piel.\f* over the earth, over the face of the expanse of the heavens.”
\v 21 And God created the great sea monsters and every living being which creeps with which the waters swarm by their kind and all the winged birds by their kind and God saw that it was good.
\v 22 And God blessed them saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
\v 23 And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
\v 24 And God said, “Let the land bring forth living beings by their kind, cattle and creeping things and beasts of the land by their kinds,” and it was so.
\v 25 And God made the beasts of the land by their kinds and the cattle by their kinds and all the creeping things of the ground by their kinds and God saw that it was good.
\v 26 And God said, “Let us make man in our image according to our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the saw and over the birds of the heavens and over the cattle and over all the earth and over all the creeping things which creek on the earth.”
\v 27 And God created man in his image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them.
\v 28 And God blessed them and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and every beast which creeps on the earth.”
\v 29 And God said, “Behold I have given to you every herb bearing fruit which is on the face of all the earth and all the trees which are fruit trees yielding seed, for you they shall be for food.
\v 30 And to every beast of the land and to every bird of the heavens and to all the things which creep on the earth in which is the breath of life, every green herb for food,” and it was so.
\v 31 And God saw all which he had made and behold it was very good, and there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
