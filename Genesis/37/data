\v 1 And Jacob was dwelling (3, M, S, Q, Imf., VC) in the land of the dwelling place of his father, in the land of Canaan.
\v 2 These are the generations of Jacob: Joseph who was seventeen years old, was shepherding (M, S, Q, Part.) the sheep with his brothers, and he was a young man, that is with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, the wives of his father. And Joseph brought (3, M, S, Hi., Imp., VC) a bad report to their father.
\v 3 And Israel loved (3, M, S, Q, Per.) Joseph more than all of his sons because he was the son of his old age and he made (3, M, S, Q, Per.)a tunic with long skirts and sleeves for him.
\v 4 And his brothers saw (3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC) that their father loved (3, M, S, Q, Per.) him more than all his brothers and they hated (3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC) him and they were not able (3, M, P, Q, P) to speak (Pi., IC) peacefully with him.
\v 5 And Joseph dreamt (3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC) a dream and he told (3, M, S, Pi., Imp., VC) it to his brothers and they added (3, M, P, Hi., Imp., VC) more hate to him.
\v 6 And he said (3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC) to them, "Please hear (M, P, Q, Impv.) this dream which I have dreamt (1, C, S, Q, Per.).
\v 7 And behold we were binding (M, P, Pi., Part.) sheaves in the middle of the field and behold my sheaf rose up (3, F, S, Q, Per.) and was also standing (3, F, S, Ni., Per.) and behold your sheaves surrounded (3, F, P, Q, Imp.) and bowed down (3, F, P, Hish., Imp., VC) to my sheaf.
\v 8 And his brothers said (3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC) to him, "Shall you surely (Q, IA) reign (2, M, S, Q, Imp.) over us? Or shall you surely (Q, IA) rule (2, M, S, Q, Imp.) over us?" And they added (3, M, P, Hi., Imp., VC) still more hatred against him on account of his dream and his word.
\v 9 And he dreamt (3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC) still another dream and he recounted (3, M, S, Pi., Imp., VC) it to his brothers, and he said (3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC), "Behold, I have dreamt (1, C, S, Q, Per.) a dream again and behold the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down (M, P, Hish., Part.) to me."
\v 10 And he recounted (3, M, S, Pi., Imp., VC) it to his father and his brothers, and his father rebuked (3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC) him and he said (3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC) to him, "What is this dream which you have dreamt (2, M, S, Q, Per.)? Shall I and your mother and your brothers surely (Q, IA) come (1, C, P, Q, Imp.) to bow down (Hish., IC) to the ground to you?"
\v 11 And his brothers were jealous (3, M, P, Pi., Imp., VC) of him, but his father kept (3, M, S, Q, Per.) the matter.
