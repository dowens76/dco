\v 1 Now the serpent was (Qal, Perf., 3ms, hy*h*) more crafty than every animal of the field which the Lord God had made (Qal, Perf., 3ms, hc*u*), and he said to the woman, “Has God really said (Qal, Perf., 3ms, rm^a*), ‘You shall not eat (Qal, Impf., 2mp, lk^a*) from every tree of the garden’?”
\v 2 And the woman said (Qal, Impf., 3fs, rm^a*) to the serpent, “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we eat (Qal, Impf., 1cp, lk^a*),
\v 3 but from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God said (Qal, Perf., 3ms, rm^a*), ‘You shall not eat (Qal, Impf., 2mp, lk^a*) from it and you shall not touch (Qal, Impf., 2mp, ug*n*) it lest you die (Qal, Impf., 2mp, tWm).’”
\v 4 And the serpent said (Qal, Impf., 3ms, rm^a*) to the woman, “You will not surely (Qal, Inf. Abs., tWm) die (Qal, Impf., 2mp, tWm).
\v 5 For God knows (Qal, Part., ms, ud^y*) that on the day you eat (Qal, Inf. Con., 3mp suff., lk^a*) from it and your eyes are opened (Niph., Perf., 3mp, jq^p*) that you will be (Qal, Perf., 2mp, hy*h*) like God, knowing (Qal, Part., mp, cons., ud^y*) good and evil.”
\v 6 And the woman say (Qal, Impf., 3fs, ha*r*) that the tree was good for food and that it was desireable to the eyes and the tree was desireable (Niph., Perf., 3ms, dm^j*) to give insight (Hiph., Inf. Cons., lk^c*), she took (Qal, Impf., 3fs, jq^l*) from its fruit and she ate (Qal, Impf., 3fs, lk^a*) and she gave (Qal, Impf., 3fs, /t^n*) also to her husband who was with her and he ate (Qal, Impf., 3ms, lk^a*).
\v 7 And the eyes of the two of them were opened (Niph., Impf., 3fp, jq^P*) and they knew (Qal, Impf., 3mp, ud^y*) that they were naked and they sewed (Qal, Impf., 3mp, rp^T*) leaf of fig tree and they made (Qal, Impf., 3mp, hc*u*) for themselves loin-covering.
\v 8 And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the wind of the day and the man and his wife hide themselves (Hith.) from the Lord God in the trees of the garden.
\v 9 And The Lord called to the man and he said to him, “Where are you?”
\v 10 And he said, “I heard your voice in the garden and I saw that I was naked and I hid myself.”
\v 11 And he said, “Who told you that you are naked? Have you eaten from the tree which I commanded you not to eat from?”
\v 12 And the man said, “The woman whom you gave to me she gave to me from the tree and I ate.”
\v 13 And the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me and I ate.
\v 14 And the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above every animal and above every living creature of the field. You will go on your belly, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
\v 15 Enmity I will put between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed; he will crush you on the head, and you will snap him at the heel.”
\v 16 To the woman he said, “I will surely increase your pain and your pregnancy; in pain you shall give birth to children.
\v 17 And to Adam/the man he said, “Because you obeyed your wife and ate from the tree which I commanded you saying, ‘Do not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground on account of you; with hardship you will eat of it all the days of your life.
\v 18 And the thorn bush and thistle it shall grow for you, and you will eat the plant of the field.
\v 19 By the sweat of your face you will eat until you return to the ground; for from it you were taken, for you were dust, and to dust you shall return.”
\v 20 And the man caled his wife’s name Eve for she was the mother of all the living.
\v 21 And the Lord God made for the man and for his wife tunics of skin and he clothed them.
\v 22 And the Lord God said, “Behold the man has become like one of us knowing good and evil and now lest he stretch out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever…”
\v 23 And the Lord God sent them from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.
\v 24 And he drove the man out and settled him to the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim and the flame of the sword turning (Hith.) to guard the way to the tree of life.
