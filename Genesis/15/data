\v 1 After these things the word of the Lrod came to Abram in a vision saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I will be your shield, your very great reward.”
\v 2 And Abram said, “O Lord God, what will you give to me since I walk childless and the son of the inheritance of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”
\v 3 And Abram said, “Since you have not given to me a seed and behold a son of my house will be my heir.”
\v 4 And behold the word of the Lord came to him saying, “This man will not be your heir but one who comes out from your body will be your heir.”
\v 5 And he brought him outside and he said, “Please look at the heavens and count the stars if you are able to count them.” And he said to him, “Thus will your seed be.
\v 6 And he trusted in the Lord and he considered it for him as righteousness.
\v 7 And he said to him, “I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give to you this land to possess it.”
\v 8 And he said, “O Lord God how do I know I will possess it?”
\v 9 And he said to him, “Bring to me a heifer three years old and a goat three years old and a ram three years old and a dove and a young bird.”
\v 10 And he brought to him all these and he cut them into pieces and took each piece opposite the other half. Now the birds he did not cut in pieces.
\v 11 And the carrion birds came down to the carcasses and Abram drove them away.
\v 12 And the sun went and a deep sleep fell on Abram and behold dread and great darkness fell on him.
\v 13 And he said to Abram, “You will surely know that your seed will be aliens in a land that is not theirs and they will be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years
\v 14 and also the nation which they serve I will judge and after this they will go out with great possessions.
\v 15 But you will go to your fathers in peace and will be buried at a good old age.
\v 16 And the fourth generation will return here because the sin of the Amorite is not complete.”
\v 17 And the sun had gone and there was darkness and behold a furnace of smoke and a torch of fire passed through these pieces.
\v 18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying, “To your seed I will give this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates,
\v 19 the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
\v 20 and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
\v 21 and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.”
