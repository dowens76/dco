\p
\v 18 But the birth of Jesus Christ was thus. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 But Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wishing to disgrace her, wished to divorce her secretly.
\v 20 But when he was considering these things, behold an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what is in her is fathered by the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 But she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. For he will save his people from their sins."
\v 22 But all this happened to fulfill the word from the Lord through the prophet, saying,
\p
\v 23 \qt "Behold the virgin will become pregnant, and his name they will call Immanuel." \qt*
\p which is translated, "God with us."
\v 24 But when Joseph got up from sleep, he id as the angel of the Lord commanded him and he took his wife,
\v 25 and he did not know her until when she bore a son. And he called his name Jesus.
