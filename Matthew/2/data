\v 1 But after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
\v 2 saying, "Where is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and we came to worship him."
\v 3 But when King Herod heard he was shaken and all Jerusalem with him,
\v 4 and he called together all the chief priests and scribes of the people and inquired from them where the Christ was to be born.
\v 5 But they say to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea." For so it is written through the prophet:
\q1
\v 6 "And you, Bethlehem, land of Judea,
\q2 By no means are you least among the rulers of Judah;
\q1 For from you will come a ruler,
\q2 Who will shepherd my people Israel."
\p
\v 7 Then Herod secretly called the magi and determined precisely from them the time the star appeared,
\v 8 and he sent them to Bethlehem saying, "Go inquire carefully concerning the child. But when you have found him, report to me so that I also may come to worship him."
\v 9 But they heard the king and went, and behold the star, which they say in the east, led them until it came above where the child was.
\v 10 But when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.
\v 11 And entering the house, they saw the childw ith Mary his mother, and they fell and worshipped him and opened their treasure boxes and offreed to him gifts of gold and frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they returned by another way into their country.
\p
\v 13 But after they departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, "Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and be there until I say to you; for Herod is about to seek the child to kill him."
\v 14 And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and withdrew to Egypt,
\v 15 and he was there until the death of Herod, in order that the word from the Lord through the prophet may be fulfilled,
\pc "Out of Egypt I called my son."
\p
\v 16 Then Herod saw that he was tricked by the magi he was very angry, and he sent to execute all the children inBethlehem and in all its region from two years old and under, according to the time determined by the magi.
\v 17 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled,
\pc
\v 18 The voice of Rama was heard,
\pc weeping and much mourning,
\pc Rachel called her children,
\pc And she does not wish to be comforted,
\pc For they are not.
\p
\v 19 But when Herod died, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying "Get up, take the child and his mother and go into the land of Israel; for those seeking the life of the child have died."
\v 21 But he got up and took the child and his mother and came to the land of Israel.
\p
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning Judea his father Herod's place,was afraid to go there; but being warned in a dream he took refuge in the region of Galilee,
\v 23 and when came he lived in a city called Nazareth in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, "He will be called a Nazarene."
