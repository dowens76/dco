\c 6
\p
\v 1 But you take care not to do your righteousness before men so that they are seen by them; otherwise, you are not having a reward with your Father in Heaven.
\v 2 Therefore whenever you should do charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet before you (i.e.: trumpet achievements), just as the hypocrites (pretenders) are doing in the synagogues and in the alleys, in order that they might be glorified by men; truly I am saying to you, they are receiving their reward.
\v 3 But while you are doing charitable giving do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
\v 4 in order that your charitable giving might be in secret; and your Father who is seeing in secret shall reward you.
\p
\v 5 And whenever you are praying, you shall not be as the hypocrites, because they are loving to pray in the synagogue and on the street corners while they are standing, in order that they might be seen by men; truly I am saying to you, they are receiving their reward.
\v 6 But whenever you should pray, come into your innermost room and after you close your door pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who is seeing in secret shall reward you.
\p
\v 7 But while you are praying don't babble just as the Gentiles, for they are thinking that they shall be heard with their many words.
\v 8 Therefore do not become like them; for your Father is knowing of what things you are having a need before you ask him.
\p
\v 9 Therefore in this way you are praying:
\p Our Father the one who is in heaven
\p Let your name be treated as holy;
\p
\v 10 Let your kingdom come;
\p Let your will happen,
\p as in Heaven also on earth;
\p
\v 11 Give to us today our neccessary bread;
\p
\v 12 And forive for us our debts (sins),
\p as also we have forgiven our debtors;
\p
\v 13 And do not lead us into temptation,
\p but deliver us from the evil one.
\p
\v 14 For if you should forgive for the men their sins, your heavenly Father shall forgive even you;
\v 15 but if you should not forgive the men, nor shall your father forgive your sins.
\p
\v 16 But whenever you should fast, do not become as the hypocrites with a gloomy look, for they are making their faces unrecognizeable in order that they might show themselves to men while they are fasting; truly I am saying to you, they are receiving their reward.
\v 17 But while you are fasting anoint for yourself your head with oil and wash for yourself your face,
\v 18 in order that you might not be seen by men while you are fasting but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who is seeing in secret shall reward you.
\p
\v 19 Do not store up for you treasures on earth, where moth and rust are destroying and where thieves are breaking in and stealing;
\v 20 but store up for you treasures in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust are destroying and where thieves are not breaking in nor stealing;
\v 21 for where your treasure is, there also your heart shall be.
\p
\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore if your eye should be clear, your whole body shall be illuminated;
\v 23 but if your eye should be evil, your whole body shall be dark. Therefore if the light is the darkness in you, how great must the darkness be?
\p
\v 24 Not one is able to serve two lords; for either he shall hate the one and shall love the other, or he shall be devoted to one and he shall despise the other. You are not able to serve God and Mammon (wealth, property).
