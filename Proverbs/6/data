\v 1 My son, if you give security\f + \ft Qal, Per., 2, m, s\f* on behalf of your neighbor
\q2 If you strike hands\f + \ft Qal, Per., 2, m, s\f* for another
\q2
\v 2 If you have become ensared\f + \ft Ni., Per., 2, m, s\f* by the sayings of your mouth,
\q2 If you have been seized\f + \ft Ni., Per., 2, m, s\f* by the sayings of your mouth,
\q2
\v 3 Then do\f + \ft , Qal, Impv., m, s\f* this, my son, and be delivered\f + \ft Ni., Impv., m, s\f*
\q2 Because you have come\f + \ft Qal, Per., 2, m, s\f* in the hand of your neighbor.
\q2 Go\f + \ft , Qal, Impv., m, s\f* , humble yourself\f + \ft Hith., Impv., m, s\f* , and pester\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s\f* your neighbor
\q2
\v 4 Do not give\f + \ft Qal, Juss., 2, m, s\f* sleep to your eyes
\q2 And slumber to your eyelids
\q2
\v 5 Deliver yourself\f + \ft Ni., Impv., m, s\f* like a gazelle from a hand
\q2 And like a bird from the hand of a fowler.
\q2
\v 6 Go\f + \ft , Qal, Impv., m, s\f* to the ant, lazy one,
\q2 Observe\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s\f* her ways and become wise\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s\f* .
\q2
\v 7 Who, for her there is no leader
\q2 Nor officer\f + \ft , Qal, Part., m, s\f* nor ruler\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* .

\q2 She gathers in\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, f, s\f* her food in the harvest.
\q2
\v 9 How long, O lazy one, will you sleep\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, m, s\f*
\q2 When will you rise\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, m, s\f* from your sleep?
\p
\v 10 A little sleep, a little slumber
\q2 A little folding hands to sleep\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con., +\f*
\p
\v 11 And your poverty will come\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, m, s\f* like a tramp
\q2 And your want like an insolent man.
\p
\v 12 A worthless person, a man of trouble
\q2 He walks\f + \ft , Qal, Part., m, s\f* with a perversion of mouth
\p
\v 13 He winks\f + \ft , Qal, Part., m, s\f* his eye,
\q2 He scrapes\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* his foot,
\q2 He throws\f + \ft Hiph., Part., m, s\f* his fingers
\p
\v 14 With perversity in his heart he prepares\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* evil
\q2 At all times he sends out\f + \ft Piel, Impf., 3, m, s\f* disputes
\p
\v 15 Therefore his disaster will come\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* suddenly
\q2 In an instant he will be broken\f + \ft Niph., Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2 And there will be no healing
\p
\v 16 There are six things the Lord hates\f + \ft , Qal, Per., 3, m, s\f*
\q2 And seven abominations of his being
\p
\v 17 Eyes that deceive\f + \ft Qal, Part., f, p\f*
\q2 A tongue of deception
\q2 And hands that shed\f + \ft , Qal, Part., f, p\f* innocent blood
\p
\v 18 A heart which plans\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* intentions of harm
\q2 Feet which hurry\f + \ft Piel, Part., f, p\f* to run\f + \ft , Qal, Inf. Con., + \f* to evil
\p
\v 19 A false witness who produces\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* lies
\q2 And who sends out\f + \ft Piel, Part., m, s\f* disputes between brothers.
\q2
\v 20 Guard\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s\f* , my son, the commands of your father
\q2 Do not abandon\f + \ft , Qal, Juss., 2, m, s\f* the instruction of your mother

\v 21 Bind them\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s, + 3, m, p suffix\f* upon your heart continually
\q2 Tie them\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, s, + 3, m, p suffix\f* around your neck
\q2
\v 22 When you walk about\f + \ft , Hith., Inf. Con., + b\f* , she will guide\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* you
\q2 When you lie down\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* she will keep watch\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* over you
\q2 And when you will awake\f + \ft , Hiph., Per., 2, m, s\f* she will occupy your attention\f + \ft , Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f*
\q2
\v 23 For a commandment is a lamp and instruction is a light
\q2 And the way of life is rebukes of discipline
\q2
\v 24 To guard you\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* from the evil woman
\q2 From the smooth tongue of the foreigner
\q2
\v 25 Do not desire\f + \ft Qal, Juss., 2, m, s\f* her beauty in your heart
\q2 And do not let her take you\f + \ft Qal, Juss., 3, f, s\f* by her eyelids.
\q2
\v 26 For the price of a woman who is a harlot\f + \ft Qal, Part., f, s\f* is up to a round of bread
\q2 And the wife of a man hunts\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* for precious life
\q2
\v 27 Can a man take away\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* fire in his bosom
\q2 And his garments are not burned\f + \ft , Niph., Impf., 3, f, s\f* ?
\q2
\v 28 If a man walks\f + \ft , Pi., Impf., 3, m, s\f* on glowing charcoal
\q2 Will not his feet be scorched\f + \ft Niph., Impf., 3, f, p\f* ?
\q2
\v 29 So is the one who comes\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* to the wife of his neighbor
\q2 Every one who touchs\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* her will not remain unpunished\f + \ft Ni., Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2
\v 30 They do not despise\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, p\f* a thief when he steals\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2 To fill\f + \ft Piel, Inf. Con.\f* himself when he is hungry\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2
\v 31 But when he is found\f + \ft Niph., Per., 3, m, s\f* he repays\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 3, m, s\f* sevenfold
\q2 All of the wealth of his house he gives\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2
\v 32 The one who commits adultery\f + \ft , Qal, Part., m, s\f* with a woman is one who has no sense
\q2 The one who destroys\f + \ft Hiph., Part., M, s\f* himself, he will do it\f + \ft , Qal, Impf.., 3, m, s\f*
\q2
\v 33 Affliction and shame he will find\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2 And his disgrace will not be wiped out\f + \ft Niph., Impf., 3, f, s\f*
\q2
\v 34 For jealousy is the rage of man
\q2 And he will not feel compassion\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* on the day of vengeance
\q2
\v 35 He will not lift up\f + \ft , Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* before any ransom
\q2 And he will not accept\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* when a gift is abundant\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f*
