\v 1 And it came to pass when all the kings of the Amorites who are on the other side of the Jordan to the sea and all the kings of the Canaanites who are on the sea heard\f + \ft Q, IC\f* how the Lord dried\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Per.\f* the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel until we passed through\f + \ft 1, C, P, Q, Per.\f* that their hearts melted\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* and spirit was not yet in them from before the children of Israel.
\v 2 At that time the Lord said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* to Joshua, Make\f + \ft M, S, Q, Imp.\f* for you flint knives and return\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Impv.\f* circumcise\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* the Israelites a second time.
\v 3 And Joshua made\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Imp.\f* for himself flint knives and he circumcised\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp.\f* the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
\v 4 Amd this is the reason for which Joshua circumcised\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* all the people who went out\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* from Egypt who were men all men of war died\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* in the wilderness in the way in their going out\f + \ft Q, IC\f* from Egypt.
\v 5 Because all the people who came out\f + \ft M, P< Q, Part.\f* were circumcised\f + \ft M, P, Q, Pass Part.\f* and all the people who were born\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* in the wilderness in the way of their going out\f + \ft Q, IC\f* from Egypt were not circumcised\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* .
\v 6 For the children of Israel walked\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* forty years in the wilderness until all the nation, the men of war who came out\f + \ft M, P, Q, Part.\f* from Egypt who didnt obey the Lord, was complete\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* , to whom the Lord swore\f + \ft 3, M, S, Ni., Per.\f* in order that they should not see\f + \ft Hi., IC\f* the land which the Lord swore\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* to their fathers to give\f + \ft Q, IC\f* to us a land flowing\f + \ft F, S, Q, Part.\f* milk and honey.
\v 7 And he raised\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hi., Per.\f* their children under them; Joshua circumcised\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Per.\f* them because they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* them in the way.
\v 8 And it came to pass as all the nation completed\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Per.\f* circumcising\f + \ft Ni., IC\f* that they sat\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* under them until they lived\f + \ft Q, IC\f* .
\v 9 And the Lord said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to Joshua Today I have rolled\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f* the reproach of Egypt from upon you, and he called\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* the name of that place Gilgal until this day.
\p
\v 10 And the children of Israel camped\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* in Gilgal and they did\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* the Passover sacrifice on the fourteenth day to the month in the evening on the plains of Jericho.
\v 11 And they ate\f + \ft 3, C, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* from the produce of the land on the day after the Passover on that same day, unleavened bread and roast\f + \f* .
\v 12 And the manna ceased\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* on the next day when they were eating\f + \ft Q, IC\f* from the produce of the land and there was not still manna for the children of Israel and they ate\f + \ft 3, M, P, Q, Imp., VC\f* from the yield of the land of Canaan in that year.
\v 13 And it came to pass in the day when Joshua was\f + \ft Q, IC\f* in Jericho that he lifted\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* his eyes and he say\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp, VC\f* and behold a man was standing\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* opposite him and his sword was drawn\f + \ft F, S, Q, Pass. Part.\f* in his handand Joshua went\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* toward him and he said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to him Are you for us or our foe?
\v 14 And he said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to him that I am an officer of the army of the Lord; now I have come\f + \ft 1, C, S, Q, Per.\f*  and Joshua fell\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to his face to the ground and he bowed down\f + \ft 3, M, S, Hisht., Imp., VC\f* and he said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to him What is my lord speaking\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* to his servant?
\v 15 And the officer of the army of the Lord said\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* to Joshua Take off\f + \ft M, S, Q, Impv.\f* your shoe from upon your foot because the place which you are standing\f + \ft M, S, Q, Part.\f* upon is holy and Joshua did\f + \ft 3, M, S, Q, Imp., VC\f* thus.
