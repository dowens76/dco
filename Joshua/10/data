\v 1 And it happened when Adonai-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua captured Ai and had devoted it to the ban\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms, <rj\f* as he had done to Jericho and to its king, thus he did to Ai and to its king and and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace\f + \ft Hiph., Perf., 3cp\f* with Israel and they were in their midst.
\v 2 And they were exceedinhly afraid because Gibeon was a great city like one of the royal cities and because it was greater than Ai and all of its men were mighty.
\v 3 And Adonai-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, king of Hebron and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,
\v 4 “Come up to me and help me and let us strike Gibeon for it has made peace with Joshua and the children of Israel.”
\v 5 And they gathered and the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon went up, they and all their armies and they encamped by Gibeon and they fought\f + \ft Niph., Impf., 3mp\f* against it.
\v 6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal saying, “Do not let your hand drop\f + \ft Hiph., juss., 2ms, hpr\f* from your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites dwelling on the mountain have gathered against us.”
\v 7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of battle with him and all the mighty men of valour.
\v 8 And the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them for I have given them into your hand. A man from them will not stand before you.”
\v 9 And Joshua came to them suddenly coming up from Gilgal all night.
\v 10 And the Lord confused them\f + \ft Puall, Impf., 3ms, <mj\f* before Israel and struck them\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms\f* with a great blow at Gibeon and pursued them on the way of the ascent of Beth-Horon and struck them until Azekah and Makkedah.
\v 11 And it happened when they fled from before Israel they were at the descent of Beth-Horon and the Lord threw large stones at them from heaven as far as Azekah and they died; the multitude which died by the hailstones where more than those whom the Israelites had killed by the sword.
\v 12 Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day the Lord gave\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con., /tn\f* the Amorites before the Israelites and he said in the sight of Israel, “Sun, be still\f + \ft Qal, Impf., ms, <md\f* at Gibeon and moon in the valley of Aijalon.”
\v 13 And the sun was still and the mood stood until the nation avenged\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, <qn\f* its enemies. Is it not written in the book of Jashar? And the sun stood in the middle of the sky and did not hasten\f + \ft Qal, Perf., 3ms, JWa\f* to go about a whole day.
\v 14 And there was not a day like this day before it or after it when the Lord listened to the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel.
\v 15 And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
\v 16 Now [Note: digressing] these five kings fled and they hid themselves\f + \ft Niph., Impf., 3mp, abj\f* in the cave at Makkedah.
\v 17 And it was told to Joshua saying, “The five kinds have been found hidding\f + \ft Niph., Part., mp\f* in the cave at Makkedah.”
\v 18 And Joshua said, “Roll large stones to the mouth of the cave and appoint men by it to guard them.
\v 19 And you shall not stand; pursue after your enemies and you will cut them off\f + \ft Pi., Perf., 2mp, bnz\f* . Do not let them go to their cities for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.”
\v 20 When Joshua and the Israelites finished striking them with an exceedingly great blow until completion\f + \ft Qal, Inf., Con.\f* , the survivors escaped from them and they came to the fortified cities.
\v 21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one cut his tongue against the Israelites.
\v 22 And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring out to me these five kings from the cave.”
\v 23 And they did so and they brought out to him these five kings from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
\v 24 And it happened as they brought out\f + \ft Hiph., Inf. Con.\f* these kings to Joshua that Joshua called to every man of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come near, put your feed on the necks of these kings.” And they came near and placed their feet on their necks.
\v 25 And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed; be strong and be courageous for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies whom you fight.
\v 26 And Joshua struck them after thus and he put them to death\f + \ft Hiph., Impf., 3ms\f* and hung them\f + \ft hlt\f* on five trees and were hanging\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part.\f* on the trees until evening.
\v 27 And it happened at the time the sun came, Joshua commanded and they brought them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they hid themselves and they placed great stones at the mouth of the cave until this very day.
\v 28 And Joshua captured Makkedah on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword and its king; he devoted them to the ban with every life which was in it; he did not leave a survivor and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.
\v 29 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed by Makkedah to Libnah and fought with Libnah.
\v 30 And the Lord also gave it into the hand of Israel and its king and he struck it with the edge of the sword and every life which was in it he did not leave in it a survivor and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\v 31 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed by Libnah to Lachish and camped against it and fought with it.
\v 32 And the Lord gave Lachish into the hand of Israel and he captured it on the second day and struck it with the edge of the sword and every life which was in it according to all which he had done to Libnah.
\v 33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish and Joshua struck him and his people until he had left him not one survivor.
\v 34 And Joshua and all Israel with him passed on from Lachish to Eglon and they camped by it and they fought against it.
\v 35 And they captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword and every life which was in it on that day they devoted to the ban according to all which he had done to Lachish.
\v 36 And Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and they fought against it.
\v 37 And they captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and its king and all its cities and every life which was in it he did not let remain survivor according to all which he had done to Eglon and he devoted it to the ban and every life which was in it.
\v 38 And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir and they fought against it.
\v 39 And he captured it and its king and all its cities and struck them with the edge of the sword and they devoted to the ban every life which was in it. He did not leave over a survivor; as he had done to Hebron, thus he did to Debir and to its king and as he had done to Libnah and its king.
\v 40 And Joshua struck all the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings; he did not leave a survivor and all breath he devoted to the ban as the Lord the God of Israel had commanded.
\v 41 And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-Barnea and until Gaza, and all the land of Goshen and until Gibeon.
\v 42 And all these kings and their land Joshua captured at one time for the Lord the God of Israel fought for Israel.
\v 43 And Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
