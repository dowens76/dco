\v 1 And it happened in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah\f + \fr 36.1: \ft Cf. 2 Kgs 18:13. Provan, Long, and Longman note that Hezekiah's sole succession date would be 714 BC, to line up with Sennacherib's invasion in 701 BC (p. 272). 2 Kings 18:7 records Hezekiah's rebellion against Assyria, which PLL date to Sargon's death in 705 BC, which was a time of widespread rebellion (p. 273). Envoys of the Babylonian king Merodach Baladan appear in 2 Kgs 20:12-19, which PLL suggest means the rebellions after Sargon's death were coordinated. That Hezekiah attacked the Philistine kings Sillibel and Padi (of Ekron), who remained loyal to Assyria, likewise suggests Hezekiah was a leading figure in the rebellion against Assyria (p. 273). Hezekiah's offer of tribute was not enough to satisfy Sennacherib; he wanted complete surrender (pp. 273–74). p. 274: "Sennacherib does not claim to have taken Jerusalem at any point, nor even to have received tribute from Hezekiah in the immediate aftermath of the siege. he tells us only that after his return to Nineveh (whose occasion he does not describe) Hezekiah sent tribute on." They remark that this fits with Hezekiah's original intention (2 Kgs 18:13–16), so we have no reason to doubt Sennacherib.\f* that Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the fortified\f + \fr 36.1: \ft So NRSV/ESV/NIV. Holladay: "impregnable."\f* cities of Judah and he captured them.\f + \fr 36.1: \ft Qal, Wayyiqtol, 3ms, +3mp suffix, תפשׂ.\f*
\v 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh\f + \fr 36.2: \ft What is the story with this title?\f* from Lachish\f + \fr 36.2: \ft Suggests Sennacherib was in Lachish after he conquered it. Lachish was the last fortified city to fall, I think. Check on this.\f* to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with heavy strength,\f + \fr 36.2: \ft ESV: "a great army."\f* and he stood up at the conduit of the upper pool on the road of the Launderer's field.
\v 3 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, went out to him with Shebna the scribe and Joah, son of Asaph the recorder.\f + \fr 36.3: \ft So ESV/NIV. Hiph., Part., ms, זמר "to make known, announce."\f*
\v 4 And Rabshakeh said to them, "Please say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: What is this trust that you trust?
\v 5 I said,\f + \fr 36.5: \ft Qal, Qatal, 1cs, אמר. But note 1QIsa and many Hebrew manuscripts and 2 Kgs 18:20 reads תָּ-, "you have said." So also NIV. MT is more difficult reading.\f* only a word of the lips is this counsel and strength for war. Now in whom do you trust that you rebel\f + \fr 36.5: \ft Qal, Qatal, 1cs, מרד.\f* against me?
\v 6 Behold, you trust in this staff of a reed that is broken,\f + \fr 36.6: \ft Qal, Pass. Part, ms, רצץ.\f* on Egypt which, a man leans against it and it will come into his palm and pierce it.\f + \fr 36.6: \ft Qal, Qatal, 3ms, +3fs suffix, נקב.\f* Thus is Pharaoh, king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
\v 7 And when you say to me, "In Yhwh our God we trust," is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah cleared away\f + \fr 36.7: \ft Hiph., Qatal, 3ms, סוּר. This is an interesting interpretation of Hezekiah's reforms from a foreign king.\f* and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, "Before this altar you shall worship"?\f + \fr 36.7: \ft Hisht., Yiqtol, 2mp, שׁחה.\f*
\v 8 And now please make a wager\f + \fr 36.8: \ft Hith., Impv., ms, ערב.\f* with my lord the king of Assyria: I will give to you two thousand horses if you are able to put riders on them.
\v 9 How shall you turn back the face of one governor\f + \fr 36.9: \ft So Holladay, p. 291. ESV: captain.\f* of the least of the servants of my lord and you trust for yourself in Egypt for chariot and horsemen?
\v 10 And now is it without Yhwh that I have come up to this land to destroy it? Yhwh said to me, 'Go up to this land and destroy it.'"
\v 11 And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic for we can understand, and do not speak to us in the language of Judah in the hearing of the peopel who are on the wall."
\v 12 But Rabshakeh said, "Has my lord sent me to your lord and to you to speak these words? Has he not [also sent me] to the men who are sitting on the wall to eat their dung and to drink their urine with you?"
\v 13 And Rabshakeh stood up and he called in a loud voice in the Judahite language and he said, "Listen to the words of the great king of Assyria!
\v 14 Thus says the king, 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he is not able to save you.
\v 15 And do not let him make you trust in Yhwh saying, "Yhwh will surely save us! This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria."
\v 16 Do not lisen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: make a blessing with me and come out to me, and each man will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and each man will drink water from his own cistern
\v 17 until I come and take you to to a land like your land, a land of grain and wine,\f + \fr 36.17: \ft Holladay, p. 389: archaic word in ritual and poetic texts.\f* a land of bread and vineyards.
\v 18 Beware lest Hezekiah lead you astray saying, "Yhwh will save us!" Have any of the gods of the nations delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
\v 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they saved Samaria from my hand?
\v 20 Who among all the gods of these lands has saved their lands from my hand that Yhwh will save Jerusalem from my hand?"
\p
\v 21 But they kept silent and did not answer him a word because the command of the king was, "Do not answer him."
\v 22 And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the sribe and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah with torn garments and they told to him the words of Rabshakeh.
