\q1
\v 17 For behold I am creating a new heavens and a new earth,
\q2 And the former things will not be remembered,
\q2 Nor will they come up in to the heart.
\q2
\v 18 On the contrary, rejoice and shout for joy forever at what I am creating!
\q2 For behold I will create Jerusalem for rejoicing and her people for exultation
\q2
\v 19 And I will rejoice over Jerusalem and exult over my people
\q2 And a voice of weeping or a cry of distress will not be heard in her again
\q2
\v 20 And there will not be from then on an infant of a few days
\q2 Or an old man who will not fill his days
\q2 For the young man will die at a hundred years
\q2 And the one who misses a hundred hears will be cursed
\q2
\v 21 And they will build houses and dwell in them
\q2 And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit
\q2
\v 22 They will not build and another dwell in them
\q2 Nor plant and another eat
\q2 For as the days of the tree are the days of my people
\q2 And the work of their hands my chosen ones will use to the full
\q2
\v 23 And they will not toil in vain
\q2 And they will not bear children to sudden terror
\q2 For they are the offspring of the blessed Lord
\q2 And their offspring with them
\q2
\v 24 And it will be that before they call I will answer
\q2 And while they are speaking I will hear
\q2
\v 25 The wolf and the lamb will graze as one
\q2 And the lion like cattle will eat straw
\q2 And the serpent, dust will be his bread
\q2 They shall not do evil nor shall they destroy
\q2 On all the mountain of My Holiness," says the Lord.
