\v 1 Now a branch will come out from the stem of Jesse and a shoot from his roots will bear fruit.
\v 2 And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
\v 3 And he will delight\f + \ft ???\f* in the fear of the Lord and he will not judge by what his eyes see nor decide by what his ears hear.
\v 4 And he will judge the weak in righteousness and he will decide with uprightness for the poor of the land and he will strike the land with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips he will put to death the wicked.
\v 5 And righteousness will be the girdle of his loins and firmness the waistcloth of his loins.
\v 6 And the wolf will sojourn with the lamb and the leopard will lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a small lad will drive them.
\v 7 And the cow and the bear will graze together, their young will lie down and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
\v 8 And the sucking infant will play over the hole of the cobra and over the den of the viper the weaned child\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part.\f* will stretch out his hand.
\v 9 The will not hurt and they will not destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.
\v 10 And on that day the root of Jesse which stands as a signal for the peoples, for him the nations will seek and his resting place will be glorious.
\v 11 And on that day the Lord will again a second time acquire with his hand the remnant of his people who remain from Assyria and from Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.
\v 12 And he will lift up a signal for the nations and he will gather the banished ones of Israel and the shattered ones\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part.\f* of Judah he will assemble from the four corners of the earth.
\v 13 And the jealousy of Ephraim wil turn aside and those who show hostility to Judah will be cut off\f + \ft Niph., Impf.\f* ; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah and Judah will not show hostility to Ephraim.
\v 14 And they will fly on the shoulder of the Philistines in the west; together they will plunder the Easterners; Edom and Moab their hand will stretch outstretch\f + \ft ?\f* and the Ammonites will be their subjects.
\v 15 And the Lord will slit the tongue of the sea of Egypt and wave his hand over the river with his scortching\f + \ft ?\f* wind and he will strike it into seven streams and make them march on sandals.
\v 16 And there will be a highway for the remnant of his people who remain from Assyria as there was for Israel on the day they went up out of the land of Egypt.
