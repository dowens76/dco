\c 6
\p
\v 1 In the year King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the hem of his robe filled the temple.
\v 2 Seraphim were standing above him with six wings, six wings for each one. With two he covered his face and with two he covered his feet and with two he flew.
\v 3 And one called to another and said, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts; his glory fills all the earth."
\v 4 And the hinges/pivot of the thresholds shook at the sound of his calling and the building was filled with smoke.
\v 5 And I said, "Woe is me for I am ruined for I am destroyed, for I am a man of unclean lips and I live in the midst of a people with unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
\v 6 And one from the seraphim flew to me and with his hand he took a coal with tongs from the altar
\v 7 and he touched my mouth and he said, "Behold this has touched your lips and your guilt is taken away and your sin is covered."
\v 8 And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" And I said, "Behold me, send me."
\v 9 And he said, "Go and say to this people, â€˜Listen continually and do not understand; look continually and do not know.
\v 10 Make the heart of this people grow fat (unreceptive) and its ears heavy and its eyes shut lest he should see with his eyes and hear with his ears and understand with his heart and turn and heal itself."
\v 11 And I said, "Until when, Lord?" and he said, "Until the cities lie desolate from no inhabitants and houses from no people and the ground lies desolate.
\v 12 The LORD has put people far away and multiplied the abandoned places in the midst of the land.
\v 13 And still in it is a tenth and it will return and will be for burning like a mighty tree and like a stately tree which when it is felled there is a stump. Among them the holy seed is its stump.
