\v 1 For behold the Lord God of Hosts is turning aside from Jerusalem and from Judah support and supply, all support of bread and all suport of water.
\v 2 Mighty man and man of battle, judge and prophet and diviner and elder,
\v 3 leader of fifty and one bearing rank\f + \ft ?\f* , and the counselor and wise in magic and the distinguisher of charms,
\v 4 and I will set young men as their leaders and caprice shall rule over them.
\v 5 And the people will oppress each other and each man his neighbor, the youth will act arrogantly with the elder and the dishonored with the honored.
\v 6 For a man will lay hold of his brother of the house of his father, "You have a cloak, you will be our ruler, and this overthrown mass under your hand."
\v 7 He will lift up on that day saying, "I will not be the one to bind up and in my house there is no bread and there is no cloak; you will not set me as the leader of the people."
\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen because their tongue and their deeds are against the Lord to be rebellious of the eyes of his glory.
\v 9 The look on their faces testifies against them, and they tell of their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it; woe to them for they repay evil to themselves.
\v 10 Say to the righteous that it is good for they will eat the fruit of their works.
\v 11 Woe to the wicked; it shall be bad for the dealing of his hands will be to him.
\v 12 My people, those who act arbitrarily are the ones who oppress them and women will rule over them; my people, those who make you go straight wander about and the way of their paths they have confused.
\v 13 The Lord has taken his stand to contend and he stands to judge the peoples.
\v 14 The Lord comes in judgment with the elders of his people and their leaders; and you cleared away the vineyard, the spoil of affliction is in your houses.
\v 15 What is it to you that you crush my people and the faces of affliction you grind, declares the Lord of Hosts.
\v 16 And the Lord said, "Because the daughers of Zion are haughty and walk with out-stretched necks and walking with ogling eyes\f + \ft ?\f* and walking with quick steps\f + \ft ?\f* and rattling their feet.
\v 17 And the Lord will strike the head of the daughters of Zion with a scab and the Lord will lay bare their sockets\f + \ft secret parts?\f* .
\v 18 On that day the Lord will turn aside the beauty of their anklets, front bands, crescents,
\v 19 ornaments, bracelets, veils,
\v 20 head-dresses, marching\f + \ft ?\f* , sashes, perfume bottles, amulets,
\v 21 signet-rings, nose-rings,
\v 22 the robes, the overtunics, the cloaks, the purses,
\v 23 the tablets, the linen wrappers, the turbans, and the large veils.
\v 24 And it will be that instead of perfume there wil be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a rope, and instead of hair arrangement, baldness, and instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth, and burning instead of beauty.
\v 25 Your men will fall by the sword and your men of valor in battle.
\v 26 Her gates will mourn and lament, being empty she will sit on the ground.
