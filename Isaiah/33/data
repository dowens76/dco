\q1 Sinners tremble in Zion,
\q2 trembling seizes godless ones,
\q1 "Who among us may sojourn in the consuming fire?
\q2 Who among us may sojourn on the everlasting hearth?

\q1 He who walks in righteousness,
\q2 And he speaks uprightly;
\q1 He rejects the profit of extortion,
\q2 He shakes his hands lest they hold on to a bribe;
\q1 He stops his hears from hearing of bloodshed,
\q2 And he closes his eyes from seeing evil.

\v 16
\q1 He will dwell on the heights,
\q2 Strongholds of rocks will be his refuge;
\q1 His bread is given,
\q2 His water is reliable.
