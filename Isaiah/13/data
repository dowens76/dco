\v 1 The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah son of Amoz saw:
\v 2
\q1 On a bare mountain lift up a standard,
\q2 Raise a voice to them
\q1 Wave a hand and let them come
\q2 To the doors of the nobles.
\v 3
\q1 I myself commanded
\q2 to those of mine who are consecrated
\q1 Also I call to my mighty ones for my anger
\q2 exultant ones of my pride*?*.
\v 4
\q1 The sound of a tumult*?* is on the mountains
\q2 the likeness of a numerous people
\q1 the sound of an uproar of the kingdoms
\q2 nations gathering
\q1 The LORD of Hosts is mustering
\q2 hosts for battle
\v 5
\q1 They com from a distant land
\q2 from the end of the heavens
\q1 The LORD and the instruments of his indignation
\q2 to destroy the whole land
\v 6
\q1 Wail for the day of YHWH is near
\q2 like the ruin of the Almighty
\v 7
\q1 Therefore all hands sink
\q2 and all the hearts of man melt
\v 8
\q1 And they are disturbed with pangs and anguish seize them*?*
\q2 Like a woman in labor they writhe
\q1 A man will be astounded with his neighbor
\q2 their faces are flaming faces
\v 9
\q1 Behold, the day of YHWH is coming, cruel
\q2 and fury and burning anger
\q1 to make*?* the land a waste
\q2 and its sinners will be destroyed from it
\v 10
\q1 For the stars of the heavens and their constellations
\q2 they do not shine their light
\q1 The sun will darken in its rising
\q2 and the moon will not shine its light
\v 11
\q1 And I will judge the world for evil
\q2 And the wicked for their sin
\q1 And I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant
\q2 And the arrogance of the tyrants I will bring down
\v 12
\q1 I will make man rarer than pure gold
\q2 And man than the gold of Ophir
\v 13
\q1 Therefore I will shake the heavens
\q2 And the earth will shake from its place
\q1 On account of the fury of YHWH of Hosts
\q2 In the day of his anger
\v 14
\q1 And it will be that like the hunted *?* gazelle
\q2 And like sheep and there is no one gathering
\q1 Each man will return to his people
\q2 And flee to his own land
\v 15
\q1 All those who are found will be pierced
\q2 And all those who are swept away will fall by the sword
\v 16
\q1 And their infants*?* will be smashed
\q2 before their eyes
\q1 Their houses will be plundered.
\q2 And their wives lain with.
\v 17
\q1 Behold I am stirring up the Medes against them
\q1 Who have no regard for silver
\q2 And gold they do not desire
\v 18
\q1 And their bows will smash young men
\q1 And on the fruit of the womb they have no compassion
\q2 Over sons their eyes do not look compassionately
\v 19
\q1 And it will be that Babylon the glory of kingdoms
\q2 the splendor and pride of t e Chaldeans
\q1 Like God's overthrow
\q2 of Sodom and Gomorrah
\v 20
\q1 It will not be dwelled in for a lasting time
\q2 And it will not be inhabited forever
\q1 And an Arab will not pitch a tent there
\q2 And shepherds will not lie down there
\v 21
\q1 But demons will lie there
\q2 And their houses are full of howli wild creatures
\q1 There ostriches/owls will dwell
\q2 And he-goats will lie down there
\v 22
\q1 jackals* will answer in its towers*?*
\q2 and jackals in the palaces of pleasure
\q1 It's time is coming near
\q2 And its days will not be extended.
