\v 1 And (it happened)\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s, + vav cons.\f* in the days of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, (that) Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel went up to Jerusalem for battle and they were not able to attack\f + \ft Niphal, Inf. con.\f* it.
\v 2 And it was told\f + \ft Hoph., impf., 3, m, s + vav cons.\f* to the house of David saying, "Aram has rested on Ephraim," and his heart and the heart of the people quivered like the trees of the forest quiver from before the wind.
\v 3 And the Lord said to Isaiah, "Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son to the end of the water-course of the upper pool to the highway of the field of the fuller.
\v 4 And you will say to him, ‘Keep watch and be quiet, do not fear and do not let your heart be weak on account of these two stumps of smoking firebrands burning with anger, Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah
\v 5 because Aram has counseled evil against you with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah saying,
\v 6 "Let us go up against Judah and let us tear it apart\f + \ft Hiph, Impf., 1cp, cohortative\f* and let us break through it for ourselves and let us set up the son of Tabeel as king in its midst."
\v 7 Thus says the Lord God, it shall not stand and it shall not happen.
\v 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus and the head of Damascus is Rezin and in still sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered\f + \ft Qal Impf. 3ms\f* from being a people.
\v 9 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria is is the son of Remaliah. If you will not continue believing then you will not remain.’"

\v 10 And the Lord continued to speak to Ahaz saying,
\v 11 "Ask for yourself a sign from the Lord your God, which is deep like Sheol or high above."
\v 12 And Ahaz said, "I will not ask and I will not test the Lord."
\v 13 And he said, "Listen, O house of David. Is it a trifle for you to weary men that you also weary my God?
\v 14 Therefore the Lord himself will give to you a sign, behold a young woman/virgin is pregnant and she is bearing a son and she will call his name Immanuel.
\v 15 He will eat curds and honey when he knows to reject evil and to choose good.
\v 16 For before the boy knows to reject evil and to choose good, the land, whose two kings you dread, will be abandoned\f + \ft Niph. Impf. 3ms\f* .
\v 17 The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon the house of your father days which have not come from the day Ephraim turned aside from Judah, the king of Assyria.
\v 18 And it will be on that day that the Lord will whistle for the fly which is at the end of the stream of Egypt and to the bee which is in the land of Assyria.
\v 19 And they will come and all of them will rest in the ravines of the precipices and in the clefts of the cliffs and in all the thorn-bushes, and in all the pastures.
\v 20 On that day the Lord will shave with a razor hired in the region across the river, with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the legs and also it will snatch away the beard.
\v 21 And it will be on that day that a man may keep alive\f + \ft Piel Impf. 3ms\f* a heifer and two sheep.
\v 22 And it will happen from the abundance of milk produced that he will eat curds, for all who remain in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey.
\v 23 And it will happen on that day that every place where there were a thousand vines for a thousand (pieces) of silver will become thorns and will be thorn bushes.
\v 24 With arrows and bows he will come there for all the land will be thorns and thorn bushes.
\v 25 And all the mountains which the hoe hoed, you will not go there for fear of thorns and thorn bushes and it will be for letting oxen loose and for sheep to trample."
