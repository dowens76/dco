\c 10

\v 1 Woe to those who enact statutes of iniquity and those who write down trouble,
\v 2 to thrust aside\f + \ft Hiph., Inf. Con.\f* the needy from judgment and to rob justice of the affliction of my people so that widows are their spoil and they plunder orphans.
\v 3 And what will you do for the day of punishment and for devastation which will come from afar? You will flee to whom for help? And where will you leave your riches?
\v 4 Nothing but to bow down among prisoners or among the slain to fall; in all this his anger does not return and still his hand is stretched out\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part.\f* .
\v 5 Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger and the staff in whose hand is my indignation.
\v 6 Against a profane nation I send\f + \ft Piel\f* them and against the people of my fury I command them to plunder the plunder and to plunder the spoil and to place trampling like cement of the streets.
\v 7 But it is not like thus and its heart does not think thus but to destroy in its heart and to cut off nations not a little.
\v 8 For it says, "Are not my princes alike to kings?
\v 9 Is not Calno like Carchemish? Or Hamath like Arpad? Or Samaria like Damascus?
\v 10 As my hand attained to the kingdoms of the idol and their idols are greater than Jerusalem and Samaria,
\v 11 shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and to its idols, thus I will do to Jerusalem and to its idols?"
\v 12 And when the Lord accomplishes\f + \ft Piel\f* all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, "I will visit upon\f + \ft punish\f* the fruit of the greatness of heart of the king of Assyria and upon the glory of the height of his eyes."
\v 13 For he said, "By the strength of my hand I act and by my wisdom for I have understanding\f + \ft Niphal\f* and I turned aside the borders of the peoples and their stored up things I plundered and I brought down the inhabitants like a mighty man.
\v 14 And my hand attains like to a nest to the wealth of th epeoples and as one gathers abandoned eggs, all the earth I gathered and there was not\f + \ft one which\f* fluttered its wing and opened its mouth and chirped."
\v 15 Shall the axe glorify itself over the one who chops with it? Shall the saw magnify itself over the one who wields\f + \ft Hiph.\f* it? That would be like a club wielding the one who lifts it or like a staff raising one not of wood.
\v 16 Therefore the Lord God of Hosts will send on his stout ones a wasting disease and under his glory he will kindle a fire like a blazing flame.
\v 17 And the light of Israel will be a fire and his holy one a flame and it will burn and devour its thornbushes and its briars in one day.
\v 18 And the glory of his forest and his orchard from life until flesh he will wipe out as one wasting away and faltering.
\v 19 And the rest of the trees of the forest will be a number and a lad will write them down.
\v 20 And on that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will not again rely on the one who struck them\f + \ft Hiph., Part\f* and but will rely on the Lord, the Holy One of Israel in truth.
\v 21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the Mighty God.
\v 22 Although your people Israel were like the sand of the sea, the remnant will return in them, a destruction is determined\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part.\f* overflowing with righteousness.
\v 23 For a complete destruction, and it is determined, the Lord God of Hosts will do in the midst of the land.
\v 24 Therefore thus says the Lord God of Hosts, "Do not be afraid, my people dwelling in Zion, of Assyria who strikes with the rod and his staff he lifts up against you in the way of Egypt.
\v 25 For still a little while my wrath will be finished and my anger will be to their destruction."
\v 26 The Lord of Hosts will arouse against him a whip like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb and his staff will be on the sea and he will lift it up in the way of Egypt.
\v 27 And on that day he will remove his burden from on your shoulders and his yoke from upon your neck and it will be broken because of olive oil\f + \ft fatness?\f* .
\v 28 He has come against Aiath, he has passed through Migron, at Michmash he attended to his baggage.
\v 29 They have gone through the pass, "Geba will be our lodging place." Ramah trembles, Gibeah of Saul has fled.
\v 30 Cry with your voice, O daughter of Gallim, give attention\f + \ft Hiph., Impv.\f* , Laishah, afflicted Anathoth.
\v 31 Madmenah has fled, the inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge\f + \ft Hiph., Perf.\f* .
\v 32 Yet today at Nob he will stand, he shakes his hand at the mountain of the house/daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.
\v 33 Behold the Lord, the Lord of Hosts lops off boughs with a crash and those who are high will be hewn down\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part.\f* and the exalted will become low.
\v 34 And he will strike off the thickets of the forest with an iron axe and Lebanon will fall by the Majestic One.
