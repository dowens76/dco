\c 14
\p
\q1
\v 1 For YHWH will have compassion on Jacob
\q2 And he will again choose Israel
\q1 And he will settle them in their land
\q2 And the sojourner will join them
\q1 And they will join the house of Jacob.
\q1
\v 2 And the peoples will take them and bring them to their place
\q2 And the house of Israel will inherit them in the land of YHWH as male slaves and female slaves
\q1 And they will take captive those who took them captive
\q2 And they will rule those who drove them.
\q1
\v 3 And it will be on the day YHWH has given rest to you from your hardship and from your turmoil
\q2 And from the hard service which was placed on you
\q1
\v 4 And you will take up this saying against the king of Babylon, and you will say:
\q2 "How the despot ceases
\q3 The attack ceases.
\q2
\v 5 The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked,
\q3 The rod of rulers.
\q2
\v 6 That struck peoples in rage
\q3 Beating without stopping
\q2 Governing the nations in anger
\q3 Pursuing without holding back.
\q2
\v 7 The whole earth is at rest and at peace;
\q3 They are serene with shout of joy.
\q2
\v 8 Even junipers rejoice for you,
\q3 The cedars of Lebanon
\q2 <Since you laid down
\q3 The cutter has not come up against us.>
\q2
\v 9 Sheol beneath trembles for you
\q3 To meet when you come;
\q2 Rousing for you the ghosts
\q3 All the leaders of the earth;
\q2 He raises from their thrones
\q3 All the kings of the nations.
\q2
\v 10 All of them will answer and say to you,
\q3 <Even you were made weak like us,
\q2 Like us you have become!>
\q2
\v 11 Your pride is brought down to Sheol
\q3 The sound of your harps;
\q2 Underneath you maggots are spread out as a couch
\q3 And your covers are worms.
\q2
\v 12 How you have fallen from heaven,
\q3 O morning star, son of the dawn!
\q2 You are broken in pieces to the earth,
\q3 You who defeated the nations!
\q2
\v 13 You said in your heart,
\q3 <To heaven I will ascend,
\q2 Above the stars of God
\q3 I will raise my throne;
\q2 And I will sit on the mount of assembly
\q3 In the far reaches of the north
\q2
\v 14 I will ascend on the heights of the clouds
\q3 I will be like the Most High.>
\q2
\v 15 But to Sheol you are brought down,
\q3 to the far reaches of the pit.
\q2
\v 16 Those who see you will stare at you
\q3 They will consider you closely:
\q2 <Is this the man who made the earth tremble,
\q3 Who shook kingdoms,
\q2
\v 17 Who made the world like a desert
\q3 And its cities he demolished,
\q2 Its prisoners he did not cause to go home?>
\q2
\v 18 All the kings of the nations, all of them
\q3 lie in glory, each in his tomb;
\q2
\v 19 but you are cast out from your grave
\q3 like a shoot that is loathed,
\q2 Clothed with the killed,
\q3 those pierced with a sword,
\q2 Who go down to the stones of the pit
\q3 like a corpse trampled*?*.
\q2
\v 20 You will not join with them in burial
\q3 For your land you have destroyed,
\q2 Your people you ahve killed.
\q3 Let not the seed of evildoers be named forever!
\q2
\v 21 Prepare a slaughter for his sons
\q3 On account of the guilt of their fathers,
\q2 Lest they rise and possess the earth,
\q3 And fill the face of the world with cities."
\q1
\v 22 "I will rise against them," declares YHWH of Hosts,
\q2 "And I will cut off from Babylon name and remnant and descendents and posterity,"
\q3 declares YHWH.
\q2
\v 23 "And I will make it the possession of the hedgehog
\q3 And reed pools of water
\q2 And I will sweep it away with the broom of destruction,"
\q3 declares YHWH of Hosts.
\q1
\v 24 The Lord of Hosts has sworn,
\q2 "Surely as I intend
\q3 thus it will be,
\q2 And as I have decided
\q3 it shall stand,
\q2
\v 25 To break Assyria in my land
\q3 And on my mountains I will trample him underfoot
\q2 And his yoke will turn aside from upon them,
\q3 And his burden from on his shoulders will turn aside."
\q1
\v 26 This is the purpose that is planned concerning the whole earth,
\q2 And this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations.
\q1
\v 27 For YHWH of Hosts has planned,
\q2 And who will annul*?*?
\q1 His hand is stretched out,
\q2 And who will turn it back?
\p
\v 28 In the year King Ahaz died there was this pronouncement:
\q1
\v 29 Do not rejoice, O Philistia, all of you,
\q2 That the rod that struck you is broken
\q1 For from the root of the snake will come forth a viper
\q2 And its fruit will be a burning serpent*?*.
\q1
\v 30 And the firstborn of the poor will graze
\q2 And the needy will lie down secure;
\q1 but I will put to death your root with famine
\q2 And your remnant I will kill.
\q1
\v 31 Wail, O gate, cry out, O city;
\q2 Melt in fear, O Philistia, all of you!
\q1 For From the north smoke is coming,
\q2 And there is no one alone in his band.
\q1
\v 32 And what will one answer the messengers of the nation?
\q2 "The LORD has laid the foundations of Zion,
\q1 And in her the afflicted of his people seek refuge."
