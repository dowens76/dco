\c 16

\q1
\v 1 Send a lamb ruler of the land
\q2 from Sela to the desert,
\q2 until the mount of the daughter of Zion.
\q1
\v 2 And like fleeing birds, an abandoned nest
\q2 shall the daughrers of Moab be, the fords of the Arnon.
\q1
\v 3 Bring counsel, make a decision,
\q2 Place your shadow like the night at noon
\q1 Hide the scattered,
\q2 Do not reveal the one fleeing.
\q1
\v 4 Let the scattered of Moab sojourn among you,
\q2 Be a hiding place for him from before the destroyer.
\q1 When the oppressor has come to an end; destruction has finished, and the one who tramples is finished from the land,
\q1
\v 5 A throne will be established in steadfast love
\q2 And he will sit on it in faithfulness in the tent of David,
\q2 The one who judges and seeks justice and is expeditious with righteousness.
\q1
\v 6 We have heard of the pride of Mobab, how exceedingly proud
\q2 His pride and his arrogance and his haughtiness; it is not right in his boasting.
\q1
\v 7 Therefore let Moab wail for Moab, let everyone wail.
\q2 For the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth, mourn, totally afflicted.
\q1
\v 8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, the vine of Sibmah, the lords of the nations have struck down its clusters reaching as far as Jazer, spreading out to the desert
\q2 its shoots spread out, passing over to the sea.
\q1
\v 9 Therefore I weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Simbah;
\q2 I drench you with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh;
\q1 For over your summer and your harvest the shout has fallen.
\q1
\v 10 And joy and gladness are gathered from the fertile land
\q2 And in the vineyard there is no shout for joy, no loud calling
\q1 There is no one treading wine in the press,
\q2 I have put an end to shouting.
\q1
\v 11 Therefore my inward parts moan for Moab like the harp
\q2 And my inner parts for Kir Hareseth.
\p
\v 12 And when Moab appears, when he becomes weary on the high place and he comes to his sanctuary to pray he will not be able.
\v 13 This is the word which YHWH has spoken to Moab from that time.
\v 14 And now the word of YHWH saying, "In three years like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be lightly esteemed in all its great wealth and the remainder will be very few, not great.
