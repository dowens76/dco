\c 8

\v 1 And the Lord said to me, "Take for yourself a large tablet and write on it with a stylus a man for Maher shalal hash baz\f + \ft swift is booty, speedy is prey\f* .
\v 2 And I will cause witnesses who are faithful to bear witness for me, Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah."
\v 3 So I came near to the prophetess and she conceived and gave birth to a son and the Lord said to me, "Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hashbaz
\v 4 for before the boy knows to call "My father," and "My mother," he will take away the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria."
\v 5 And the Lord continued to speak to me again saying,
\v 6 "Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoicing in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
\v 7 therefore behold the Lord is bringing up on them the mighty and abundant waters of the river, the king of Assyria and all his glory and he will go up on all its channels and he will come on all its banks.
\v 8 And it will pass through in Judah and overflow and it will pass by and reach to the neck and it will be that the spreading of its wings will fill the breadth of your land, Immanuel.
\v 9 Be broken\f + \ft NASB\f* O peoples, and be dismayed and liste, all the distant places of the earth. Gird yourselves and be dismayed; gird yourselves and be dismayed.
\v 10 Give advice and it will be broken, speak a word and it will not stand for God is with us."
\v 11 For thus the Lord said to me as with strength of the hand and he admonished me\f + \ft not\f* to walk in the way of this people saying,
\v 12 "You will not say, ‘Conspiracy,’ to all which this people says is a conspiracy and what they fear you will not fear and you will not tremble.
\v 13 The Lord of Hosts, you will regard him as holy, and he will be your fear and he shall cause you to tremble.
\v 14 And he will be a sanctuary and for a stone of strinking and for a rock of stumbling for the two houses of Israel for a bird trap and for a snare for the inhabitant of Jerusalem.
\v 15 And many will stumble on them and they will fall and they will be broken and will be lured and captured.
\v 16 Bind the testimony, seal the law in my disciples.
\v 17 And I will wait for the Lord who hides his face from the house of Jacob and I will wait for him.
\v 18 Behold I and the children whom the Lord gave to me for signs and for portents in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, who dwells on mount Zion.
\v 19 And when they say to you, "Seek the wizards and the spiritists who peep and groan," should not a people seek its God? Or the dead will still living?
\v 20 To the law and to the testmony! If they do not speak according to this word where there is for it no charm.
\v 21 And he will pass through it, be hard-pressed and hungry and it will be when they are hungry that they will be in a rage and will curse their king and their god with face upward.
\v 22 And to the land they will look and behold distress and darkness and gloom and distress and they will be banished in darkness.
\v 23 For there will not be gloom for the one who was in distress. As in former times he was slight with the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali and later he will make glorious, the way of the sea passing through the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
