\v 1 The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz perceived concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 2 And it shall happen\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, m, s\f* in the end of days that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* established\f + \ft Ni., Part., m, s\f* at the head of the mountains and will be raised\f + \ft , Ni., Part., m, s\f* above the hills and all the nations shall stream\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f* to it.
\v 3 And many peoples will come\f + \ft , Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f* and say\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f* , "Come\f + \ft , Qal, Impv., m, p\f* let us ascend\f + \ft Qal, Coh, 1, c, p\f* to the hill of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob and he will teach us\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s, + 1, c, p suffix\f* his ways that we may walk\f + \ft , Qal, Impf., 1, c, s\f* in his paths because out of Zion comes\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
\v 4 And he will judge\f + \ft , Qal, Per., 3, m, s\f* between the nations and he will decide\f + \ft Hi., Per., 3, m, s\f* for many peoples and they will beat\f + \ft Pi., Per., 3, c, p\f* their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; a nation shall not lift up\f + \ft , Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* a sword against a nation and they will not train for battle\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* again.
\v 5 O house of Jacob come\f + \ft , Qal, Impv., m, p\f* , let us come\f + \ft , Qal, Coh., 1, c, s\f* into the light of the Lord.
\v 6 For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob, for they are full of things from the east and fortunetellers like the Philistines and with the children of foreigners they clap hands.
\v 7 And their land is full of silver and gold and there is no end to their treasure and their land is full of horses and there is no end to their chariots.
\v 8 And their land is full of idols, to the work of their hands they bow down to what they made with their fingers.
\v 9 A man is humbled and a man is brought low, do not lift them up!
\v 10 Come in the rock and hide in the earth from dead of the Lord and from the splendor of his majesty.
\v 11 The eyes of haughtiness of a man shall be brought low and the haughtiness of men will bow down and Lord alone will be exalted on that day.
\v 12 For the Lord of Hosts has a day against all the proud and exalted and against all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low.
\v 13 And against all the cedars of Lebanon high and lifted up and against all the oaks of Bashan;
\v 14 And against all the high mountains and against all the uplifted hills;
\v 15 and against every high watchtower and against every wall with rock;
\v 16 and against all the ships of Tarshish and against all the excellent ships;
\v 17 and the haughtiness of man will bow and the haughtiness of men will be brought down and the Lord alone will be exalted on that day.
\v 18 And the idols will completely vanish.
\v 19 And they will come into the caves in the rocks and in the wholes in the earth before the terror of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to make the earth tremble.
\v 20 On that day men will cast his idols of silver and idols of goald which they made for themselves to worship for the moles and for the bats to dig,
\v 21 to come in the crevices of the rocks and in the clefts of the cliffs before the terror of the Lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to make the earth tremble.
\v 22 Cease for yourselves from man who has breath in his nostrils for with what is he esteemed?
