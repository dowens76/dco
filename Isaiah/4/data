\c 4
\p
\v 1 And seven women will take hold of one man on that day, saying, "We will eat our food and wear our clothes only let your name be called for us; remove our reproach."
\v 2 On that day the sprout of the Lord will have beauty and honor and the fruit of the land excellent and there will be glory for those of Israel who escaped.
\v 3 And it will be that the one who is left in Zion and the one who remains in Jerusalem will be called holy for him, every one who is written among the living in Jerusalem.
\v 4 when the Lord washes the filth of the daughters of Zion and rinses the blood of Jerusalem from her midst with the breath of judgment and the breath of devastation.
\v 5 And the Lord will create over the whole place of Mount Zion, and over her convocation a cloud and smoke by day, brightness of a fiery flame by night for over all her glory will be a canopy.
\v 6 And a booth will be for a shadow by day from the heat and a refuge and shelter from the storm and rain.
