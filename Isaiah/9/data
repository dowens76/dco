\c 9
\p
\v 1 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwell in a dark land a light has shined on them.
\v 2 You have multiplied the nation, you have enlarged the joy; they have rejoiced before you like the gladness in the harvest as they rejoice in their dividing the spoil.
\v 3 For the yoke of their oppression and the staff of their shoulder, the rod of the one who oppresses them you have shattered as the day of Midian.
\v 4 For every shoe tramping in a commotion, and a garment rolled in blood will be for burning, fuel for the fire.
\v 5 For a child is born to us, a son is given to us, and dominion is on his shoulder, and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
\v 6 To the abundance of his dominion and peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and on his kingdom, to establish it and to sustain it in justice and in righteousness from now and forever; the zeal of the Lord of Hosts will do this.
\v 7 The Lord sends a word against Jacob, and it falls on Israel.
\v 8 All the people know, that is Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, in pride and greatness of heart, saying,
\v 9 "The bricks have fallen down and dressed stone we will build; the sycamores have been cut down and and we will replace the cedars\f + \ft Hiph Impf 1cp\f* ."
\v 10 And the Lord exalts the adversaries of Rezin against them and his enemies he provokes.
\v 11 The Arameans from the east and the Philistines from the west (other side), and they will consume Israel with a whole mouth; in all of this his anger does not turn back and his hand is still stretched out\f + \ft Qal PassPart fs\f* .
\v 12 And the people do not turn back to the one who struck them and the Lord of Hosts they do not seek.
\v 13 And the Lord cuts from Israel the head and the tail, the palm branch and the reed stalk in a single day.
\v 14 An older and one who lifts his face is the head and the prophet who teaches deception is the tail.
\v 15 And those who lead this people go astray and those who lead him are confused.
\v 16 Therefore over their choice men the Lord does not rejoice and the orphan and the widow he does not have compassion, for all of them are godless and do evil and every mouth speaks stupidity; in all of this his anger does not turn back and his hand is still stretched out.
\v 17 For wickedness burns like a fire, thorns and thorn-bushes it consumes and kindles in the thickets of the forest and they roll up in a column of smoke.
\v 18 By the wrath of the Lord of Hosts the land is burned and the people are like fuel for the fire; a man does not take compassion on his brother.
\v 19 He devours on his right and is hungry; he consumes on his left and he is not satisfied. A man eats the flesh of his arm.
\v 20 Manasseh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh, together they are against Judah; in all of this he does not turn back his anger and still his hand is stretched out.
