\v 1 An oracle concerning Moab:
\q1 Because at night Ar of Moab is laid waste
\q2 (Moab) is destroyed
\q1 Because by night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
\q2 (Moab) is destroyed.
\q1
\v 2 He has gone up to the house and Dibon,
\q2 the high places for weeping
\q1 Over Nebo and over Medeba
\q2 Moab wails
\q1 On every one of its heads is baldness
\q2 Every beard is taken away.
\q1
\v 3 In the streets they put on sack-cloth,
\q2 On its roofs and in its squares all howl and go down in weeping
\q1
\v 4 And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out,
\q2 As far as Jahaz their voice is heard,
\q1 Therefore those ready for battle of Moab will shout,
\q2 HIs soul trembles in him
\q1
\v 5 My heart cries out for Moab,
\q2 Her fugitives (go) to Zoar,
\q2 to Eglath-shelishiyah
\q1 For the ascent of Luhith
\q2 they ascend with weeping
\q1 For the way of Horonaim
\q2 They stir up a cry of destruction
\q1
\v 6 For the waters of Nimrim
\q2 Are a desert
\q1 For the grass is dried up
\q2 the fresh grass fails,
\q2 There is no grean plant.
\q1
\v 1 Therefore he has made a savings
\q2 And their stored up things by the brook of the poplars (Euphrates?) they bear them.
\q1
\v 8 For the cry for help has surrounded the border of Moab
\q2 As far as Eglaim goes her howling
\q2 And Beer-Elim is her howling.
\q1
\v 9 For the waters of Dimon are full of blood,
\q2 For I will place upon Dimon more things,
\q1 For the escaped of Moab a lion,
\q2 And for the remnant of the land.
