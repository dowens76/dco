\c 51
\q1
\v 1 Listen\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, p\f* to me, those who pursue\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, p\f* righteousness,
\q2 Those who seek\f + \ft Pi., Part., m, p\f* Yhwh,
\q2 Look\f + \ft Hi., Impv., m, p\f* to the rock from which you were hewn\f + \ft Pual, Per., 2, m, p\f*,
\q2 And to the quarry from which you were dug\f + \ft Pual, Per., 2, m, p\f*.
\q2
\v 2 Look\f + \ft Hi., Impv., m, p\f* to Abraham your father,
\q2 And to Sarah who brought you to birth\f + \ft Polel, Impf., 3, f, s\f* \f + \ft See Deut 32:18.\f*,
\q2 "When he was one I called him\f + \ft Qal, Per., 1, c, s\f*,
\q2 And I created him\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 1, c, s\f* and I made him numerous\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 1, c, s\f*."
\q2
\v 3 Surely Yhwh will comfort\f + \ft Pi., Per., 3, m, s\f* Zion,
\q2 He will comfort\f + \ft Pi., Per., 3, m, s\f* all of her ruins.
\q2 And he will make\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* her wilderness like Eden,
\q2 And her desert like the garden of Yhwh.
\q2 Exhultation and joy will be found\f + \ft Ni., Impf., 3, m, s\f* in her,
\q2 Thanksgiving and the sound of music.
\q2
\v 4 "Give attention\f + \ft Hi., Impv., m, p\f* to me, my people,
\q2 And my people, listen\f + \ft Hi., Impv., m, p\f* to me.
\q2 For instruction will go out\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* from me,
\q2 And my justice will be a light for peoples, I will give rest\f + \ft Uncertain - Hi., Impf., 1, c, s\f*.\f + \ft The syntax of this sentence is puzzling. Is there a verbless clause plus another verbal clause? Or is mispatiy instrumental or adverbial?\f*
\q2
\v 5 My righteousness is near,
\q2 My salvation has gone out\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, m, s\f*,
\q2 And my arms will judge\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, p\f* the peoples
\q2 For me the coastlands will wait\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 3, m, p\f*,
\q2 And for my arm they will wait\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 3, m, p\f* .
\q2
\v 6 Lift up\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, p\f* your eyes to the heavens,
\q2 And look\f + \ft Hi., Impf., m, p\f* to the earth below.
\q2 For the heavens like smoke will dissipate\f + \ft Ni., Per., 3, c, p\f*,
\q2 And the earth, like a garment, will wear out\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*,
\q2 And her inhabitants\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, p\f* like a gnat will die\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, p\f*.
\q2 But my salvation will be\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* forever
\q2 And my righteousness will not end\f + \ft LXX reading supposed to be: , Qal, Impf., 3, f, s\f* \f + \ft Not sure about this translation. Holladay, p. 121, has "be struck, terrified".\f*.
\q2
\v 7 Listen\f + \ft Qal, Impv, m, p\f*\f + \ft In addition to "see," the verb "listen" occurs multiple times.\f* to me, those who know\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, p\f* righteousness,
\q2 People who have my instruction in their heart,\f + \ft Cf. Ps 37 and others.\f*
\q2 Do not fear\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, m, p\f* the taunt of men,
\q2 And from their reviling words do not be dismayed\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, m, s\f*.
\q2
\v 8 For like a garment the moth will consume them\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2 And like wool the moth will consume them\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*.
\q2 And my righteousness will be\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* forever
\q2 And my salvation will be for generation to generations."
\q2
\v 9 Awake\f + \ft Qal, Impv., f, s\f* , awake\f + \ft Qal, Impv., f, s\f* , put on\f + \ft Qal, Impv., f, s\f* strength, O arm of Yhwh!
\q2 Awake\f + \ft Qal, Impv., f, s\f* like ancient times,
\q2 Generations long ago.
\q2 Was it not you who hewed out\f + \ft Hi., Part., f, s\f* Rahab?
\q2 The one who wounded\f + \ft Pi., Part., f, s\f*\f + \ft Note v. 1, where the previous verb occurs and v. 2 where a similar verb (different root but same consonants) occurs.\f* the sea monster?
\q2
\v 10 Was it not you who dried up\f + \ft Hi., Part., f, s\f* the sea?
\q2 The waters of the great deep?
\q2 The one who made\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, f, s\f* the depths of the sea into a road,
\q2 For the redeemed\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part., m, p\f* to pass through\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f*?\f + \ft Isaiah transforms the theme of Chaoskampf into the exodus from Egypt. The battle with the sea monster Rahab and the sea itself is the mythologized version of the battle against Pharaoh. Note: check for Chaoskampf motifs in Exodus 14-15 and any relationship to the gods of Egypt.\f*
\q2
\v 11 And the ransomed\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part., m, p\f* of Yhwh will return\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, p\f*,
\q2 And they will come\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f* to Zion with a ringing cry,
\q2 And eternal joy will be on their head\f + \ft s\f*.
\q2 They will overtake\f + \ft Hi., Impf., 3, m, p\f* exultation and joy,
\q2 And torment and groaning will flee\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f*.\f + \ft Note in this parallelism that emotions are personified as runners; the people catch up with exultation and joy, but torment and groaning run away.\f*
\q2
\q2
\v 12 "I, I am the one who comforts\f + \ft For this verb as the action of Yhwh, see v. 3 above.\f* you\f + \ft Pi., Part., m, s\f*,
\q2 Who are you that you fear\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, f, s\f* man who dies\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*,
\q2 And a son of man who is given\f + \ft Ni., Impf., 3, m, s\f* as grass?
\q2
\v 13 And you forget\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, m, s\f* Yhwh your Maker\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f*,
\q2 The one who stretched out\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* the heavens,
\q2 And he established\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* the earth.
\q2 And you tremble\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 2, m, s\f* continually every day,
\q2 Because of the rage of the oppressor\f + \ft Hi., Part., m, s\f*,
\q2 As he stands firm\f + \ft Polel, Per., 3, m, s\f* to destroy\f + \ft Hi., Inf. Con.\f*.
\q2 And where is the rage of the oppressor\f + \ft Hi., Part., m, s\f*?
\q2
\v 14 He hurries\f + \ft Pi., Per,. 3, m, s\f* to open\f + \ft Hi., Inf. Con.\f* the one imprisoned\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f*,
\q2 And he will not die\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* in the pit,
\q2 Nor will his bread\f + \ft Cf. Ps 37:25-26.\f* be lacking\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f*
\q2
\v 15 And I am Yhwh your God,
\q2 Who stirs\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, s\f* the sea and its waves roar\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, p\f*,"
\q2 Yhwh of Hosts is his name.
\q2
\v 16 "And I put\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 1, c, s\f* my words in your mouth,
\q2 And in the shade of my hand I have covered you\f + \ft Qal, Per., 1, c, s\f*
\q2 To plant\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* the heavens,
\q2 And to establish\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* the earth,
\q2 And to say\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* to Zion, 'You are my people.'"
\q2
\v 17 Rouse yourself\f + \ft Hith., Impv., f, s\f* , rouse yourself\f + \ft Hith., Impv., f, s\f*\f + \ft Cf. v. 9 above, which uses the same verb for Yhwh.\f*
\q2 Arise\f + \ft Qal, Impv., f, s\f* O Jerusalem,
\q2 You who have drunk\f + \ft Qal, Per., 2, f, s\f* from the hand of Yhwh,
\q2 The cup of his anger,
\q2 The cup, the cup of staggering,
\q2 You have drunk\f + \ft Qal, Per., 2, f, s\f* , you have drained\f + \ft Qal, Per, 3, f, s\f*
\q2
\v 18 There is no one to guide\f + \ft Pi,. Part., m, s\f* her,
\q2 From all the sons she has borne\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, f, s\f*
\q2 And there is no one to take\f + \ft Hi., Part., m, s\f* her by the hand,
\q2 From all the sons she has raised\f + \ft Pi., Per., 3, f, s\f*.
\q2 ?
\q2
\v 19 These two things have met you\f + \ft Qal, Part., f, p\f*,
\q2 Who will console\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* you?
\q2 Violence and breaking and famine and sword,
\q2 How shall I comfort you\f + \ft Pi., Impf., 1, c, s\f*?\f + \ft Again, for this verb, see v. 3 above.\f*
\q2
\v 20 Your sons have fainted\f + \ft Pual, Per., 3, c, p\f*,
\q2 They lie down\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f* at the head of all the streets,
\q2 Like an antelope in a net,
\q2 Full\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, p\f* of the anger of Yhwh,
\q2 The rebuke of your God.
\q2
\v 21 Therefore please hear\f + \ft Qal, Impv., m, p\f* this, afflicted one,
\q2 Drunk one, but not from wine
\q2
\v 22 Thus says\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, m, s\f* your Lord Yhwh,
\q2 And your God who has contended\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3, m, s\f* for his people:
\q2 Behold I have taken\f + \ft Qal, Per., 1, c, s\f* from your hand, the cup of staggering,
\q2 The cup, the cup of my anger,
\q2 You will no longer\f + \ft Hi., Impf., 2, f, s\f* drink\f + \ft Qal, Inf. Con.\f* again
\q2
\v 23 But I will put it\f + \ft Qal, Per., 1, c, s\f* in the hand of those who grieve you\f + \ft Hi., Part., m, p\f*,
\q2 Who have said\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3, c, p\f* to your soul,
\q2 "Bow down\f + \ft Qal, Impv., f, s\f* so that we may pass through\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 1, c, p\f* "
\q2 And you have made\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 2, f, s\f* your back like the earth,
\q2 And like the street for those who pass through\f + \ft Qal, Part., m, p\f*.
