\c 35
\q1
\v 1 The wilderness and dry land rejoice,
\q2 The desert shouts for joy and blooms like the crocus!
\q1
\v 2 It will surely blossom,
\q2 and shout for joy with rejoicing and yelling!
\q1 The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
\q2 The splendor of Carmel and Sharon;
\q1 They will see the glory of Yhwh,
\q2 The splendor of our God.
\q1
\v 3 Strengthen feeble hands,
\q2 And stumbling knees make strong.
\q1
\v 4 Say to the hasty of heart,
\q2 Be strong, do not fear.
\q1 Behold, your God, will come with vengeance,
\q2 With the reward of God, he will come and save you.
\q1
\v 5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
\q2 And the ears of the deaf will be opened.
\q1
\v 6 Then the lame will jump like the deer,
\q2 And tong of the mute will shout for joy,
\q1 For waters will break forth in the wilderness,
\q2 And streams in the desert.
\q1
\v 7 And the hot sand will become a reed pool,
\q2 And a waterless region will become springs of water;
\q1 In the home of jackals, its resting place,
\q2 Grass will become reeds and papyrus.
\q1
\v 8 And there will be there a highway and a way,
\q2 And "the way of holiness" it will be called;
\q1 And the unclean will not pass over it,
\q2 It will belong to the one who walks the way,
\q1 And the fool will not go astray.
\q1
\v 9 A lion will not be there,
\q2 And a ravenous animal will not go up on it,
\q1 And they will not be found there,
\q2 But the redeemed will walk there.
\q1
\v 10 And the ransomed of Yhwh will return,
\q2 And they will come to Zion with a shout of joy,
\q1 And everlasting joy will be on their head;
\q2 Exultation and joy they will catch up with,
\q1 And trouble and sighing will flee.
