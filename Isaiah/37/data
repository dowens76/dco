\v 1 And it happened when King Hezekiah heard that he tore his garments and he covered himself with sack-cloth and he came to the house of Yhwh.
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to Isaiah, son of Amoz, the prophet.
\v 3 And they said to him, "Thus says Hezekiah, 'This day is a day of distress and punishment and disgrace, for sons have come to the mouth of the womb but there is no strength to deliver.
\v 4 Perhaps Yhwh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh whom the king of Assyria his lord has sent to taunt the living God, and he will requite the words which Yhwh your God has heard; so you should lift up\f + \fr 37.4: \ft Not certain about this translation of the weqatal.\f* prayer for the remenant that is found.'"
\p
\v 5 And the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\v 6 And Isaiah said to them, "Thus you shall say to your lord, 'Thus says Yhwh: Do not fear because of the words which you heard with which the young men of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
\v 7 Behold I am giving a spirit in him so that he will hear a report and he will return to his land and I will make him fall by the sword in his land.'"
\p
\v 8 And Rabshakeh returned and he found the king of Assyria was fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he departed from Lachish.
\v 9 And he heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush saying, "He has come out to flight with you." And he heard and he sent messengers to Hezekiah saying,
\v 10 "Thus you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying, 'Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of Assyria.'
\v 11 Behold you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, to devote them to the ban; shall you be saved?
\v 12 Have the gods of the nations saved them, whom my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telasssar?
\v 13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, or Ivvah?"
\p
\v 14 And Hezekiah took the documents from the hand of the messengers and the read them, and he went up to the house of Yhwh, and Hezekiah spread them out before Yhwh.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed to Yhwh, saying,
\v 16 "Yhwh of Hosts, God of Israel, sitting on the Cherubim, you are God alone, for all the kingdoms of the earth, you made heaven and earth.
\v 17 Incline\f + \fr 37.17: \ft Hiph., Impv., ms, נטה.\f* your ear, Yhwh, and hear; open your eye, Yhwh, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he sent to taunt the living God.
\v 18 Surely, O Yhwh, the kings of Assyria have brought to ruins all the lands and their lands.\f + \fr 37.18: \ft Odd double accusative.\f*
\v 19 And they have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, only the work of the hands of man, wood, and stone, and they were destroyed.\f + \fr 37.19: \ft Pual, Wayyiqtol, 3mp, אבד.\f*
\v 20 And now, O Yhwh our God, sayve us from his hand and let all the kingdoms of the earth know that you are Yhwh, you alone."
\p
\v 21 And Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah saying, "Thus says Yhwh, God of Israel, 'Which\f + \fr 37.21: \ft ESV: "because." Check this.\f* you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria,
\v 22 this is the word which Yhwh spoke concerning him,
\p "She despises you,
\p she ridicules you,
\p the virgin daughter of Zion,
\p after you she shakes her head,
\p the daughter of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 23 Whom have you taunted,
\p and you have blasphemed,
\p and against whom have you raised your voice,
\p and you have lifted your eyes to the heights?
\p To the Holy One of Israel!
\p
\v 24 By the hand of your servants you have taunted the Lord,
\p And you have said, with my great chariot I have gone up to the height of the mountains,
\p To the rear portion of Lebanon and I have cut down the tallest of its cedars,
\p From the choicest of its junipers,
\p And I came to the heights of its boundary, the thicket of its orchard.
\p
\v 25 I have dug and drank water,
\p And I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of Egypt.\f + \fr 37.25: \ft Note odd form: מָזוֹר.\f*
\p
\v 26 Did you not hear from far I did it,
\p From the days of ancient times,
\p And I formed it now,
\p And I have brought it,
\p And you will become desolated places, heaps of stones, destroyed impregnable cities.
\p
\v 27 And their dwellers shortned of hand,
\p They are shattered and they are ashamed,
\p They have become plants of the field,
\p And green fresh grass,
\p Grass of the roof,
\p And a terrace\f + \fr 37.27: \ft Check this.\f* before it rises.
\p
\v 28 And your sitting and your going out and your coming, I know, and your shaking against me.
\p
\v 29 Because you have shaken against me,
\p and your ease has come up to my ears,
\p I will place my hook in your nose,
\p And my bridle in your lips,
\p And I will return you on the way by which you came.
\p
\v 30 And this shall be the sign for you, this year you will eat after-growth and in the second year what grows of its own accord,\f + \fr 37.30: \ft See Holladay, p. 255. Check this.\f* and in the third year they will sow and reap and plant vineyards and they will eat their fruit.
\v 31 And the escaped of the house of Judah, the remnant, will add a root under and give fruit upward.
\v 32 For from Jerusalem will go out a remnant, and escaped from Mount Zion, the passion of Yhwh of Hosts will do this.
\p
\v 33 "Therefore thus says Yhwh of the king of Assyria, he shall not come to this city, and he will not shoot there an arrow, and he will not meet it with shield, and he will not pour out a seige mound against it.
\v 34 On the way which he came, in it he will return, and to this city he will not come, declares Yhwh.
\v 35 But I will enclose this city to save it for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.
\p
\v 36 And the Angel of Yhwh went out and struck in the camp of Assyrian one hundred eighty-five thousand. And they arose in the morning and behold all of them were dead corpses.
\v 37 And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned. And he lived in Nineveh.
\v 38 And it happened that he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, and Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat, and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
