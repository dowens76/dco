\q1
\v 1 Who\f + \fr 53.1: \ft GKC §151.a: "מִי with the perfect (Gn 21:7, Nu 23:10, 1 S 26:9, Is 53:1, &c.) or participle (Ps 59:8, Pr 24:22, &c.), rather expresses a rhetorical question, i.e. a denial."\f* has believed\f + \ft Hi., Per., 3ms, אמן.\f* in our report?\f + \ft This question is natural given the surprised kings in vv. 12-15 above.\f*

\v 2 He grew up\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 3ms, עלה, + vav cons.; lit. "went up."\f* like a sapling before him,\f + \fr 53.2: \ft BHS: It has been proposed to read לפנֵינוּ, "before us." The lack of a clear way to differentiate the pronoun reference may be one reason to make this suggested emendation, but the text is more difficult, yet not impossible, as it stands and therefore should not be emended. Context suggests that the subject of the verb is the Servant, while the referent of "before him" is most likely Yhwh, who is mentioned in v. 1. \f*
\q2 And like a root from the dry country.
\q1 He had neither form nor splendor,
\q2 That\f + \fr 53.2: \ft GKC §166.a: "Consecutive clauses are added by means of simple wāw copulative with the jussive, especially after negative and interrogative sentences, e.g. Nu 23:19 לֹא אִישׁ אֵל וִיֽכַזֵּב וּבֶן־אָדָם וְיִתְנֶחָ֑ם God is not a man, that he should lie, and (i.e. neither) the son of man, that he should repent."

\q2 And no appearance that we should take pleasure in him\f + \ft Qal, Impf., 1cp, + 3ms suffix, חמד, + vav conj.\f*.

\v 3 He was despised\f + \fr 53.3: \ft Ni., Part., ms, בזה.\f* and forsaken\f + \fr 53.3: \ft Adjective in construct state.\f* by men,\f + \fr 53.3: \ft This plural form of אִישׁ occurs only here and Ps 141:4; Prov 8:4 (GKC §96).\f*
\q2 A man of full of pain\f + \fr 53.3: \ft Holladay 193.\f* and acquainted\f + \fr 53.3: \ft Qal, Pass. Part., ms, ידע. BHS: 1QIsa, LXX, Syriac, Vulgate וְיוֹדֵעַ "and he knows"; 1QIsb וידע "and he has known." GKC §50.f: participle here denotes "an inherent quality."

\q2 And our pains, he\f + \fr 53.4: \ft BHS: insert with a few Hebrew manuscripts, Syriac, Vulgate, הוּא. This is not necessary since it is contained in the verb. This simply makes it emphatic like the rest, which seems to be harmonizing.\f* carried them\f + \ft Qal, Per., 3ms, + 3mp suffix, סבל.\f*,
\q1 And we ourselves esteemed him\f + \ft Qal, Per., 1cp, + 3ms suffix, חשׁב.\f* him stricken,\f + \ft Qal, Pass. Part., ms, נגע.\f*
\q2 Struck down\f + \ft Hoph., Part., ms, construct, נכה.\f* by God\f + \fr 53.4: \ft IBHS 9.5.1.b: subjective genitive. That is, God does the striking.\f* and humbled\f + \ft Pual, Part., ms, ענה.\f*.
