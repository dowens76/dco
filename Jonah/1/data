\v 1 And the word of Yhwh came to Jonah son of Amittai saying,
\v 2 "Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and cry against her because their evil has come up before me."
\p
\v 3 And Jonah arose to run away\f + Qal, Inf. Con., בָּרַח.\f* to Tarshish from before Yhwh, and he went down to Joppa, and he found a ship going\f + Qal, Act. Part., fs, בּוא.\f* to Tarshish, and he gave its fare and he went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from before Yhwh.
\p
\v 4 And Yhwh threw\f + Hiph, Perf., 3ms, טול.\f* a great wind into the sea and there was a great storm in the sea and the ship was about\f + Piel, Perf., 3fs, חָשַׁב. Holladay, p. 118, suggests "about to" with the following Niphal infinitive. Alternatively, the ship could be personified as thinking or be used a metonymy for the people on the ship.\f* to be broken up.
\v 5 And the sailors were afraid and each man cried to his god and they threw\f + Hiph., Impf., 3mp, טול. Cf. v. 4. \f* the equipment that was in the ship to the sea to lighten\f + Hiph., Inf. Con., קלל.\f* (their load) from on them. Now\f + Simple vav + noun = circumstantial clause..\f* Jonah had gone down to the rear of the ship and lay down and was in a deep sleep\f + Niph., Wayyiqtol, 3ms, רדם.\f*.
\v 6 And the chief sailor (captain) drew near to him and he said to him, "What is it to you, sleeping\f + Niph., Act. Part., ms, רדם.\f*? Get up, cry to your god. Perhaps the god shall take notice\f + Hith., Impf., 3ms, עשׁת.\f* of us, and we shall not perish.
\p
\v 7 And each man said to his neighbor, "Come, and let us cast lots that we may know on account of whom\f + Combination of בְּ plus שֶׁ plus לְּ plus מִי, "because of" plus "whom" plus "for" plus "whom".\f* this evil is against us," and they threw\f + Hiph., WY, 3mp.\f* lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
\v 8 And they said to him, "Please tell to us because of whom has this evil come against us? What is your business? And from where have you come? What is your land? And from what people are you?"
\v 9 And he said to them, "I am Hebrew and I fear\f + Qal, Act. Part., ms.\f* Yhwh God of the heavens who made the sea and the dry land."
\v 10 And the men feared greatly and said to him, "What is this you have done?" because the men knew that from before the Lord he was fleeing because he told to them.
\v 11 And they said to him, "What should we do to you that the sea shall become calm from on us?" because the sea was going and raging.
\v 12 And he said to them, "Pick me up\f + Qal, Impv., ms, נָשָׂא and 1cs suffix.\f* and throw me\f + Hiph., Impv., mp, טול and 1cs suffix.\f* into the sea, and the sea shall become calm from upon you because I know that on account of me this great storm is upon you."
\v 13 And the men rowed to return\f + Hiph., Inf. Con., שׁוב.\f* to the dry land, but they were not able because the sea was coming and raging against them.
\v 14 And they cried to Yhwh, and they said, "Please, O Yhwh, do not let us destroy\f + Qal, Impf. (cohortative), 1cp, אָבַד.\f* the life of this man and do not put upon us innocent blood because you, O Yhwh, have done as you wanted.
\v 15 And they picked Jonah up, and they threw him\f + Hiph., Impf., 3mp, טול and 3ms suffix. The preformative is short because it is a distant syllable (from the accent).\f* into the sea, and the sea stood from its raging\f + Qal, Inf. Con., זעף.\f*.
\v 16 And the men feared Yhwh greatly fear, and they made a sacrifice to Yhwh, and they made vows.\f + Hiph., Perf., 1cp.\f*
