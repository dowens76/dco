\v 1 And the Lord appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah and it came to pass that Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
\v 2 And Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the belly of the fish.
\v 3 and he said:
\q2 I have called from my distress to the Lord and he answered me
\q2 from the belly of Sheol I have cried for help; You have heard my voice.
\q2
\v 4 And You have sent me to the depth in the heart of the sea and the current shall surround me
\q2 All of Your surf and Your waves have passed over me.
\q2
\v 5 And I have said "I have been cast out from before Your eyes,
\q2 However\f + \ft I will look again\f* to Your holy temple."
\q2
\v 6 Waters surrounded me until my neck; a roaring abyss surrounded me
\q2 Seaweed was wrapping around to my head.
\v 7 To the end of the mountains
\q2 I went down; the earth\f + \ft with its bars ??\f* was around me forever;
\q2 and You caused me to ascend from the grave living, the Lord my God.
\q2
\v 8 When my life was fainting upon me I remembered the Lord
\q2 and my prayer came to You, to your holy temple.
\q2
\v 9 The ones who keep vain idols shall forsake their kindness.
\q2
\v 10 And I with a voice of thanksgiving shall surely sacrifice to You
\q2 what I have vowed I shall repay; salvation is from the Lord.
\q2
\v 11 And the Lord said to the fish and he vomited Jonah to the dry land.
