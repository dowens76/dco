\v 1 And\f + \ft it was displeasing ?\f* to Jonah a great evil and he burned with anger for it.
\v 2 And he prayed to the Lord and he said "Please Lord, wasn't this my word\f + \ft while I was?\f* still on my land? Therefore I have gone before to flee to Tarshish because I have known that you are a gracious and merciful God, forbearing and with much kindness and relenting on evil.
\v 3 And now Lord please take my life from me because it is better for me to die than to live.
\v 4 And the Lord said "Is that a good cause for you to be angry\f + \ft ? - the whole quote\f* ?"
\v 5 And Jonah went out from the city and he turned from the East to the city and he made for himself there a tent and he sat under it in the protection until when he could see what shall happen in the city.
\v 6 And the Lord God appointed a ricinus-plant and it went up from upon for Jonah to be protection upon his head to deliver him from his evil and Jonah rejoiced on account of the plant with great rejoicing.
\v 7 And God appointed a worm in the rising of the dawn for the following day and it\f + \ft attacked?\f* the plant and it dryed up.
\v 8 And it came to pass as the sun rose that God appointed a scorching eastern wind and the sun\f + \ft beat down?\f* upon Jonah's head and he became faint and he asked his life to die and he said "It is better for me to die than to live."
\v 9 And God said to Jonah, "Is there a good cause for you to be angry on account of the plant?" And he said "There is good cause for me to be angry until death."
\v 10 And the Lord said, "You had\f + \ft compassion?\f* on the plant which you did not labor on and you did not bring it up\f + \ft which happened overnight and perished overnight?\f* .
\v 11 And I should not have compassion on Nineveh the great city which in it there is more than 120,000 men who do not know between right to left and many animals.
