\v 1 And the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time saying:
\v 2 "Arise, go to Nineveh the great city and cry to it the proclamation which I am speaking to you."
\v 3 And Jonah arose and he went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord and Nineveh was an\f + \ft exceedingly\f* great city to God, walking three days.
\v 4 And Jonah began\f + \ft ?\f* to go in the city walking one day and he cried and he said "Yet forty days and Nineveh\f + \ft shall\f* be destroyed.
\v 5 And the men of Nineveh trusted in God and they called a fasting and they put on sack cloths from the greatest of them to the least of them.
\v 6 When the word reached the king of Nineveh he arose from his throne and he left his garment from upon him and he\f + \ft covered ?\f* with sack cloth and he sat upon the dust.
\v 7 and he lamented and he said "In Nineveh from royal decree the king and his great men saying: The man and the beast, the cattle and the sheep shall not taste anything, they shall not eat and they shall not drink water.
\v 8 And man and beast shall cover themselves with sack cloth and they shall cry unto God violently and each man shall return from his evil way and from the wickedness which is in their hands.
\v 9 Who knows, God shall turn and have pity and He shall return from his burning anger and we shall not perish.
\v 10 When God saw their deeds that they turned from their evil way, God relented upon the evil which He spoke to do them and he did not do\f + \ft it\f* .
